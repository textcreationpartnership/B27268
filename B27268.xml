            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Treatise translated out of <hi>French,</hi> being a new Method, is presented to the World, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, being indeed the most excellent of any thing of this kind that I ever yet saw. The Author without doubt was an ingenious Man, and one that well understood the Practick part of Curing this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, which he has concisely, and in few words, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and which he has as well faithfully as learnedly declared: He uses but few Medicines, nor is there need of any more, where so great things are presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. His only Remedy is the <hi>Solar Praecipitate,</hi> which is truly the same thing with our <hi>Impetus Mineralis,</hi> the which medicament we have used for near twenty years last past, whereby it may appear, that this Authour was not the first, or only man that made use of it, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged it to the World; and that this truth may more clearly appear, you may see the same preparation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all Respects in my <hi>Phylaxa Medicinae, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 42. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Under the Title of <hi>Angelus Mineralis,</hi> Printed about six years ago: And in my Select Observations, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 57. written above eight years since, though not so long made publick: If any shall object that the <hi>Angelus Mineralis</hi> is not the same Medicine; I answer, in respect to it's force it is not, because it has a farther preparation to take away it's <hi>Emetick, Cathartick,</hi> and <hi>Salivatick</hi> properties; but setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that last, or additional process; it is then our <hi>Impetus Mineralis,</hi> which is exactly the same with our Author's <hi>Solar Praecipitate,</hi> as they who please to
<pb facs="tcp:206364:3"/>examine it may find where this Author was to court or brief, I have, in my Annotations annext, made bold to enlarge him; and where he was obscure, I have done my endeavour to clear him; and I hope I have done things so much for the better, that no man will repent his labour of reading them; and 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible these Annotations (though short) may be worth his serious consideration. The Medicines here made use of are for the most part such, whose Preparations I have published in my said <hi>Phylaxa Medicinae,</hi> and may all of them be had at my house faithfully prepared: I have a second part of this <hi>Phylaxa</hi> now fitted for the Press, which shall also in a little time be made publick, wherein I shall discover many more great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicines which I use in my, private Practice, and were never yet divulged to the World. In the mean season, the <hi>Herbal</hi> which I have for some years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, will in a short time be completed with it's Cutts, and in some few months after exposed to the publick View; the Method of it is new, yet I hope may please, and the Medical Part of it is delivered Rationally, and Chymically to the Investigation of the Powers of all things within the Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I have been for some years last past in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> World, and am but lately returned home to perfect the whole System of Medical Learning; and for the performing of which I humbly crave the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the most Great and Good God, and that he would bless me in all my honest and just Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Venereal Distemper in General, of the Name and Original thereof.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are no small Contests recorded by Authors, that are betwixt the People of several Nations, concerning the Name and Original of this Disease, which we call <hi>Venereal,</hi> because it is an Effect of <hi>Venus</hi>'s Game; or simply, the <hi>Pox,</hi> by reason of the resemblance that the Blisters appearing in some sort of <hi>Pox,</hi> bear to those of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which are called <hi>Variolae</hi> by the Physitians: In which, because there is something that is shameful and sordid; every one, to excuse himself, is forward to ascribe to his Neighbour the Source and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this Distemper. Whence it is, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206364:6"/>the <hi>French, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> do upon this account, charge one another, with volleys of continual Reproaches: But in my opinion, if it be considered, that it is two hundred Years ago, or more, since such Questions were start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Prescription upon Prescription ought to put an end to the Plea, and purchase to every one an indisputable Right to that which he does possess for these two Ages past, and more.</p>
                     <p>But why do I talk of two Ages? 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that, though the <hi>Pox</hi> has not been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually known in all Ages, yet it is very near as ancient as the World, or at least, as the impure conversation of Men, with common and debauched Women, which was before <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, when the World began to be Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As we read in the VI. Chap. of <hi>Genesis, For all flosh had corrupted his way upon the Earth.</hi> Authority, Reason and Experience do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove that the Venereal Disease began from that time.</p>
                     <p>For, we may say, once for all, without making a forceable Entry on the Divine's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that God, having at all times hated Fornication, as an horrid Sin, did likewise in all Ages of the World, punish the same, with innumerable Miserys, and bodily Diseases, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the Venereal one is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the effect of impurity, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206364:6"/>that is promised to such profligate extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy. XIX. Chap. of <hi>Ecclesiasticus, He that cleaveth to Harlots will become impudent, Moths and Worms shall have him to Heritage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, both Experience and Reason do prove the Antiquity of this Disease, for if it be true, as no body can doubt of it, that at this day, the Pox does proceed from a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Seeds which have been mixed in the same Matrix, Reason does oblige us to believe that the same thing happened to the Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chés of old, and that consequently, they could not be free from the Pox.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis known, that if a Virgin, that is perfecty sound (if the Matter be so ordered as to free her from all suspicion of the Venereal distemper) shall keep Company with half a dozen young Fellows, as sound as her self, and be debauched with them severally, time after time, some one or other of them shall quickly have the Pox, and all of them, by a repetition of Venereal Acts, shall at last be infected.</p>
                     <p>There are but too too many Examples of such Truths, and Histories might be composed of the Misfortunes that have hapned, in debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Nature, if the Circumstances were not too tedious to be related.</p>
                     <p>Books do sufficiently furnish us with such Tragical accounts; and those of Judgment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206364:7"/>are well enough satisfied, that the Pox may be got after that manner. We shall give the Natural Reason of it, when we speak to its Cause in Chap 5.</p>
                     <p>And from this we may observe, that what some Authors say of the Original of the Pox is altogether fabulous, as when they refer it to the Stars:</p>
                     <p>We shall speak of this in the Problems which we shall give upon a great number of Questions concerning the Venereal distemper.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that those who catch this Disease at this day, do not all get it, in this manner; the most part have it by Tradition, and a communication from one to another; it is an infectious distemper, whence it's natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is such, as to communicate it self, and produce the like Contagion, seeing that the Cause of it is a true Ferment, and it is of the Nature of a Ferment to multiply it self inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, hence, there needs no more than one grain of this Venereal Ferment to infect the whole World, as there is only need of one Grain of ordinary Leven, to work upon and to reduce into it's own Nature, such a quantity of Paste as should require all the Grain in the whole World to compose it; we shall speak of this Venereal Ferment, after we have given a general Idea or Description of the Venereal Disease.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Venereal distemper, of it's Description and Symptoms in general.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>SEing a Discourse does yeild no satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Reader, unless the Subject matter which is managed thereby be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by a distinct and clear Idea, I thought it convenient not to proceed further, until I shall have once shewn what the Pox or Venereal Distemper is.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that herein I cannot follow that Method, in which, when one has occasion to explain a Subject, he must give the Definition of it, that is to say, express its Essence and Nature by two Artributes, which are called <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Differentia,</hi> because, since that <hi>Genus</hi> ought to be such as contains, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>Species</hi> immediately under it, and next to it, and the difference must be essential to that which is defined, we cannot make use of any of those <hi>Genus</hi>'s, since the Disease does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but three things, <hi>viz.</hi> an intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>an ill</hi> conformation, and a solution of continuity, and we observe that the Pox does consist sometimes in one of these, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another, and often times in all the three; but it cannot be said, that it is always one of them, for instance, an Intemperament, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206364:8"/>(as some pretend) is always found with the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> which is very hard for any one to be sure of, if it be considered, that an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, being the excess of one or more qualities, the Pox is often discovered in such cases, where 'twill be very difficult to affirm, that it is that predominant quality, and what shall be said of those who have the Pox for ten years, or more, without any appearance of hurt done to any bodily function? 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary therefore to use a Term in this case that is more transcendent then that of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperament.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Attribute, called <hi>differentia,</hi> it must be taken from something which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows the Essence or Nature of the Thing; that is to say, from some essential propriety, which does always agree with every Pox, and only with the Pox; and there is no such difference found; whence it is, that the Disease cannot admit of a Regular Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But neither must it be imagined, that the Description that we are about to give, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely compleat and perfect, because that does depend on very many circumstances; as for Example, one cannot exactly comprehend the nature of that Pox which remains conceal'd in the Body, for a long time, without exhibiting any sign whatsoever, of which we shall speak
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206364:8"/>elsewhere. Whence it is, that I cannot blame those, who, to rid themselves of this trouble, do not at all define the Pox, nor write a long Treatise of that Disease, alledging with good Reason, that 'tis of very small importance to know how to define the Pox, provided they have but the skill <hi>and good fortune</hi> to cure it.</p>
                     <p>The Pox is a disposition against Nature, contagious upon the touch, occasioned by a ferment of the same Nature, arising from the corruption of the Seeds of divers Persons received and retained in the Wombs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Women, upon which one or more of these Accidents do follow, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat of Urine, or a virulent Gonorhea, or Running of the Reins, Chancers, Buboes, or Poulains, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Boyls, Condyloms, Nodes, Glands, Pains, Spots, Blisters, Tetters, Scabs, Ulcers, Rotteness, and a Caries of the Bones or Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Falling of the Hair, and many others which proceed from these, or may be common to this and other distempers.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless some of the first of these Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents mentioned in the description, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon other Diseases, but 'tis observable, that when they proceed from the Pox, they are attended with something that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, which discovers them to be the Effect of the Pox, as we shall shew, when we come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206364:9"/>to speak of them in particular, or give the marks, by which we may discern that distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from other Diseases.</p>
                     <p>And seeing the Pox does unavoidably draw after it innumerable Evils upon the Body, not to reckon those of the Mind, which appear by turns, by a great many fantastical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, in a thousand different shapes; One said well that the Pox is the <hi>Protaeus</hi> of Diseases and a Collection of all Distempers.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How many Sorts there are of the Venereal Distemper.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT appears, by the Description which we gave in the former Chapter, that we allow of only one sort of Pox, and here we affirm, that that which they call Heat of Urine, a Chancre, or Bubo, is not of a different nature from that which is called the great (or <hi>French</hi>) Pox, as we shall prove by three Arguments that are without exception.</p>
                     <p>The first is, that Heat of Urine, does as infallibly turn to the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> as the Chancre or the Poulain, upon a neglect, or ill management of the Cure; and therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206364:9"/>they must of necessity be of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The second is, that the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> and the forementioned accidents admit of the same cure, in so far at least, as they are malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Venereal.</p>
                     <p>And the third is, that the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nothing else but a Collection of those Accidents, which is manifest in Practice; and we shall give the reason thereof in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of this Discourse.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore no essential difference betwixt Heat of Urine, Chancres, Buboes, and the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> neither as to the Nature of the Malady, nor the cause whence they proceed, nor finally, as to their specific Remedy.</p>
                     <p>There is, nevertheless, an accidental dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which does consist in this, that the <hi>French-Pox</hi> does generally seize the whole Body, because the Mass of Blood is thereby infected; upon which account, it may be called, an Universal Pox and Heat of Urine, the Chancre, and the Bubo attack but one single Part, either for that the Venereal Ferment has not been carried far, since it was first communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or, that Nature has expelled it, by a vigorous influence, and, as it were, by way of an imperfect Crisis, as may be seen in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes, or finally, by some other Accident, and therefore this may be called a particular Pox.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:206364:10"/>
                     <p>In which there is also a notable difference, as to the manner of using a Specific Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and some other circumstances, which are best observed in Practice, as we shall shew in the Chapter concerning the Method of curing both sorts of the <hi>French-Pox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis further observable, that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of particular Pox, that is to say, which lyes in one Part of the Body; for it often happens in Practice, that after the Universal Pox is cured, there still remains a lurking poyson in some part of the Body, as in the Caries or Gangrene of some Bones, in some Node or Tophus, which admits of no dissolution by the action of <hi>Mercury,</hi> when all the rest of the Body is very well cleansed; and which consequently requires a particular Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Although the Pox is the same in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and at all times, and has a specific Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which is <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet it cannot be well cured but by accident, unless the Temper, Age, Sex, Tenderness (with other like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) of the Persons thereby infected, be duely considered.</p>
                     <p>For Men are commonly more strong, Women more delicate, more moist, and their Monthly Courses must direct us in the choice of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Method, when we go about their Cure; whereof we shall give an Example in the proper Chapter.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:206364:10"/>
                     <p>Those who are of a Melancholy Temper are commonly cured with the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, because their Humors are more stubborn and tenacious, and because they abound in acid, and frequently in austere humours, which are worse then the other.</p>
                     <p>Choloric Persons are easily moved, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer cold or heat less than others, wherefore the Bile, with which they abound, must not be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated, by a suddain change of those qualities. Those of a Sanguine Constitution must be often blooded, and Phlegmatic Persons fequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inured to drying Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Infants and Old-men, being more tender and feeble, ought to be look'd after accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, neither the one nor the other is fluxed, especially, if they be respectively, very young, or decrepite.</p>
                     <p>For this and many other Reasons, easy to be understood, <hi>Mercury,</hi> which in this Age is the common Medicine for this Disease, ought not to be Prepared always in the same manner, and I will say, by the by, that he that will still make use of the same Preparation, shall fall into a great many Errors, and fail in the Cure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that labour under this Disease.</p>
                     <p>'Tis further alledged that the Times or Ages of the Pox are to be distinguished, <hi>viz.</hi> its beginning, its encrease, its state, and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but seeing it is not an acute Disease, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206364:11"/>besides those times are not determined equally, and have not a regulated course, I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to bring the thing into a true light.</p>
                     <p>Because, for Example, there have been some persons, who have had the Pox, for the space of ten Years or more, without any remarkable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or fatal consequence, and others, who in the space of three Months, have become almost rotten. There are some, who upon a Chancre neglected or ill cured, shall be for two or three Years free from the consequent marks of the Pox, and others, who in six Months time, shall be therewith covered all over, the thing depending less or more on the activity of the Venereal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which they are infected, and on their good or bad constitution; we shall treat of those Questions in the Problem; in a word, the Times of this Disease are so uneven and uncertain, that there can be no standing Rule given, by the help of which we may discern them, Experience being the best guide in this matter.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis not, in my Opinion, a thing of so great importance, as to make it needful for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist any longer upon it, in this Chapter, because that which follows, and treats of the different degrees of the Pox, shall fully clear all that is necessary to be understood, in order to the giving a right Judgment of the state of this Disease.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Degrees of the Pox, and its Progress.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THat the Subject Matter of this Chapter may be made the more manifest, 'tis to be supposed that the several ways how one may get the Pox, may be reduced to three, for either the Disease is original, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the Mothers Womb, or, it is got by Copulation, or lastly, by some other external Contract, <hi>viz.</hi> by lying with those that have the Pox, or in their Linnen, after their Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Drinking after them, by Sucking or giving Suck, or in some other like manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must be supposed, till it be proved in the following Chapter, that the Cause of the Pox is a sharp and biting Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which without all Question is of the Nature of an Acid, upon which account it can coagulate or thicken the Humors, with which it is mixed, but especially the Phlegm, with which 'tis more readily mixed, then with the rest of the Humors, because there is something of an Acid naturally in all Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis to be considered, that this Ferment is by so much the more active, as 'tis the more exalted by a long Corruption,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206364:12"/>and as it does pass from a Body that is more warm and open, to another that is likewise heated, and contrarywise, that it is the less active, and consequently works more slowly, when such Conditions happen to be contrary. In these respects, the Ferment is rendred more or less fixed or volatilized.</p>
                     <p>These Grounds being laid, I shall give a View of its ordinary Progress, beginning with that which follows upon Copulation, which is the most common way of its Communication.</p>
                     <p>If a Man has the Pox, he emits into the Womans Matrix, a Seed that is full of that Venereal Ferment, which insinuates it self into those parts which are naturally disposed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as being soft, spongy, and very full of small Glands that are almost imperceptible in their natural <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Position,</hi> though they be at this day pretty well known by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomists, and sometimes do so much encrease, that they may be discerned with good Eyes. 'Tis those small Glands that easily imbibe the Venereal Ferment, which, in them, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupted, that is, it does become more sharp by remaining in them, and seeing it has the Nature of an Acid, it does fix and coagulate the Liquors that are contained in those small Glands, whence there does arise a hard small Tumor, accompanied with Pain, which is that we call a Chancre; and because
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206364:12"/>Heat does put that Ferment in Motion, which thereby does become more sharp, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a Corrosion of the Substance, and a small Ulcer begins to grow, the Limits whereof remain as yet hard, and this Ulcer encreases by little and little; this is that they call a <hi>Chancrous-Ʋlcer,</hi> and which we call a particular Pox, seeing it does only affect one part; or if one pleases, he may take this for the first Degree of the Pox, or the first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that this Venereal Ferment does make, according to our Example.</p>
                     <p>That Ferment always multiplying, does corrupt the ulcerated Parts that are next to it, and especially the Liquors that ferment more easily; hence it is, that the Blood that is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Arteries for the Nourishment of the Parts, does receive some Particles of that Ferment, and in returning by the Veins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its due Circulation, communicates those Particles to the Mass of Blood, which by degrees, comes to be sufficiently disposed, by the Accession of such Particles for a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Corruption, that is, to become it self a Venereal Ferment.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see how an Universal Pox may proceed from a small Chance, that was only at first a particular Pox.</p>
                     <p>And the Mass of Blood may be corrupted a thousand times, according to the Force of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206364:13"/>the Ferment, or Constitution of the Person.</p>
                     <p>If the Ferment be volatile enough, and the Party have Bile or Choler predominant in his Constitution, there does arise a sort of Turgen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, which makes the Humors glide, sometimes on the one side, and sometimes on the other, from whence wandring Pains do proceed.</p>
                     <p>If the Ferment is more fixed, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Melancholy, the Blood likewise becomes fixed, and does coagulate, and its Motion consequently becomes unequal and slow, which is the Cause of Weariness, want of Appetite, and decay of the Animal Spirits, ill Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ill Nourishment, together with a Depravation of the Expulsive Faculty, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>Menstrua,</hi> Hemorrhoids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Ferment be very acid, and the Person Flegmatic, that Ferment does entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it self in the Flegm, which it makes vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and thick, whence the Body comes to be chill'd, puffed up, and bleak.</p>
                     <p>If the Person be Sanguine, it does produce an unequal boyling in the Veins and Arteries; hence Inquietudes, Watchings, Heats, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, sometimes in one Part, and sometimes in another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every one may here discern by his own Reason, the Consequences of that Corruption of the Mass of Blood, for all cannot be contained in a small Treatise.</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:206364:13"/>
                     <p>And this is the second Degree of the Pox, or if you please, the first Step to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Pox.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not easie for the Mass of Blood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any long time in this Condition, but it discharges it self into all Parts of the Body, which it does moisten, and through which it does pass by a continual Circulation.</p>
                     <p>And such discharges do always happen with a great deal of Inequality, for it is a constant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim in the admirable oeconomy of the Body, as 'tis everywhere else, that the Stronger does over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Weaker, Nature that has a continual Propensity to disburden it self when oppressed, though it be provided with ordinary passages, for expelling the Impurities of the Mass of Blood, yet does not always take the same ways, especially when she is strugling with an Adversary that treats her with the greatest Violence.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if the Venereal Ferment be (though in a very small quantity) in the Mass of Blood, it may be pushed on by Heat to the Glands of the Emunctories, though by reason of its Weight, it goes downward more easily: And thus we see that there grows cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tumors in the Groin, which are called Buboes or Poulaines. Sometimes the same Matter is carried towards the Arm-pits, and frequently towards the Glands of the Neck,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206364:14"/>which become thereby very much infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes we see the Pox of such a sort, that a great Number of Glands do appear, in which case, there is a strong ground to believe that the Lymph and Lymphatic Vessels have contributed to that Discharge, seeing, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of Anatomy, the Lymph cannot pass from the Arteries in the Lymphatic Vessels, otherwise then by the Glands, through which it is filtred.</p>
                     <p>If there be a great quantity of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Mass of Blood does discharge it self by an Ebullition upon the whole Skin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we may see Spots, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Venereal Fumes; that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their being gross, do settle on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, Blisters, which in a little time grow hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and turn to Chancers or Scabs, as well great as small, Tettars, Boyls, Warts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the predominant Humor.</p>
                     <p>If the Blood discharge by Sweat, any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humours betwixt the Muscles, these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosities, by pricking the Members, do cause Pains that resemble a Rheumatism.</p>
                     <p>If these Serosities march along the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, a Nerve or a <hi>Periostium,</hi> they cause fixed Pains, with which, those who have the Pox are miserably tormented.</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:206364:14"/>
                     <p>If those Serosities affect the Joynts, they shall excite the Venereal Gout.</p>
                     <p>If that serous Matter settle at the Roots of the Hair, it does cause, by corroding the Roots, the falling off of the Hair.</p>
                     <p>And this is another Degree of the Pox. If those Serosities grow confirmed and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all along a Bone, they produce Nodes, which make yet another Degree.</p>
                     <p>If they sink into the Substance, and penetrate even to the Marrow, they cause profound Pains, and becoming more sharp by their stay there, corrode the Bone, which likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls the Cartilages.</p>
                     <p>And this is the utmost Degree of the Pox; 'Tis true, there is another Degree, worse then any of the former, because it makes the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease incurable, and the Patient is unavoidably lost, which is, when the virulent Matter does discharge it self on a Noble Part, and corrupts it; for besides that, the lost Substance can never be repaired; the bad Symptoms that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this Pox, and the Condition of the Noble Part that is affected, admit of no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Medicine.</p>
                     <p>'Tis evident therefore, that there are so many degrees of the Pox, as it does make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to take deeper root, and that from the Surface, it does pass to the Mass of Blood, from thence to the Flesh, from the Flesh to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:206364:15"/>the Membranes, and from the Membranes to the Bones.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, all these Degrees which I have described, do not keep always the same Order, for oftentimes the Pox doth pass from one Degree to another inperceptibly; and sometimes there is a Gangreen or Caries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Bones, without the Precedency of other Accidents, as it was in our Explication, and this arises from some particular Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ferment, or of the Parts of the Body, so that one Part does make a greater Resistance than another, and the Ferment makes a longer stay in one Part than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore Judgment may be best made of it according to the Disposition and State of the Patient, in which case Reason will be joyned to Experience.</p>
                     <p>'Tis easie, by this Example to judge of the Progress and Degrees of the Pox in all other kind of Examples: I shall further explain some of them, which may serve as a Rule for the rest.</p>
                     <p>I suppose that a common Woman has the Pox, and though she were not infected, if she has a particular Conversation with many Men, the Mixture of so many Seeds does oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion such a Corruption in the Passage of her Matrix, that degenerates into a proper virulent Ferment, as we shall explain in the following Chapter.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:206364:15"/>
                     <p>If then in that Case, another Man shall keep Company with that Woman, and heat himself by Copulation, he shall attract some Particles of that Ferment, which adhering to his Yard, shall produce some Chancer, in the same manner as we have explained the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and have the same Progress, very near, as the other.</p>
                     <p>But if the Venereal Ferment, which is in the Passage of the common Woman, be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently volatilized, and the Passage of the Yard, which made a Penetration, be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open, that Ferment being put in motion, shall enter into that Passage, and go to the small Caruncle, that hinders the involuntary Emission of Seed, from thence to the <hi>Prostatae</hi> and <hi>Parastatae,</hi> which are the Repositories of the Seed, and shall produce in these Parts an Inflammation and an Acrimony in the Seed (which shall corrupt it) and after a little time, one Ulcer or more in the same Parts, so that the Seed so corrupted and fermented, shall be involuntarily emitted by continual Irritations; and 'tis this involuntary Effusion of Seed that makes the first Degree of the particular Pox, which they call Heat of Urine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Gonorrhea or Running of the Reins, of which we shall treat in a Chapter apart.</p>
                     <p>This Venereal Heat of Urine may continue in some a longer, in others a less time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206364:16"/>bringing the great Pox; because of the Effusion of some other Humors with the Seed, that proceed, as it may be supposed, from some Ulcers, and carry off a part of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Ferment of those Ulcers, and blunt the Activity of what does remain therein, whence it comes to pass, that in such a Case, 'tis something slow in its Operation; but when that Ferment is volatilized or <hi>raised</hi> by Heat, the Blood which does pass through those Parts, gradually attracts into the Mass of Blood, so many Particles as are sufficient to corrupt it; after the same manner as we have said, of a Chancer at the beginning of this Chapter; and this is the Universal Pox, which makes the like Steps in its Progress with the other, which is already shown, and needs no Repetition.</p>
                     <p>If the Venereal Ferment is yet more vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, it passes not only into the Seminary Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, but also (without any stop) into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Veins, and mixing it self with the Blood, does corrupt it, and this Blood does corrupt that which is next to it, and so on, till the whole Mass be infected, and thus there is an Universal Pox, when there was no other Symptom that preceded, which is commonly very surprising, and very much deceives the World.</p>
                     <p>But if Nature be strong, before this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is much multiplied in the Mass of Blood,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206364:16"/>'tis separated by way of <hi>Crisis,</hi> and forced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Glands of the Groin, where there grows a Bubo or Poulain, and sometimes two together, when the Matter does much abound.</p>
                     <p>This may happen, when the Heat is so strong, and the Ferment so volatile, that it is expelled through the Pores with the Sweat, without the Help of any Medicine; but to speak the truth, I know very few that come off with so cheap a Cure, and he would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unadvised, who would trust to such a Chance.</p>
                     <p>After what has been said, 'tis very easie to conceive, that in what way soever the Pox is got, it does make very near one and the same Progress, that is, the Venereal Ferment acts by degrees, beginning at that place which it first seized, diffusing it self insensibly into the neighbouring parts, which it does corrupt, and these corrupting others, until the whole Body be involved in the same <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> then this Body can bring the same Fatility on an infinite number of others, because the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have no Limits, as we are now about to shew by what does follow.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Cause of the Pox, and of the Nature of the Venereal Ferment.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HItherto we have used the Term of a Venereal Ferment, which we supposed to be the Cause of the Venereal Distemper, and I think, that I cannot find a more proper one, for giving such a general Explication as shall agree with all the Opinions of reasonable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have treated of this Disease; I shall also use the same in the following part of this Treatise, for this reason, because no Body can be mistaken therein, unless he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereunto some extravagant Idea, as that of an <hi>Occult Quality,</hi> or a <hi>Quintessential Agent,</hi> which has served the turn of the Antient and the Ignorant Race, who loved not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in intricate Affairs, nor puzled with hard Questions; and also for another reason, because those who are prepossessed with another Opinion, about such kind of Subjects, will not grant (unless it be proved) that the Cause of the Pox is rather a Salt than a Mercury, or any other Principle; or that it is a true <hi>mixt</hi> Body in which a Salt is predominant; and yet none will deny this to be a true Ferment, since it has all the Qualities thereof, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206364:17"/>purpose, in this Chapter, to make good, upon plain and demonstrative Reasons.</p>
                     <p>I say then, that every Ferment is a Body whose Principles are resolved, exalted, and in such a Motion, that being applyed to another body of its own kind, can penetrate, move and finally Convert that Body into its own Nature.</p>
                     <p>And since I know that this definition does agree to all proper Ferments, that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it in such a manner as does best suit the subject in hand; ordinary Leven and common Vinegar will suffice for Examples in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>A bit of Leven being put in a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Flower that is reduced into Paste with Water, shall put the Parts of that Paste into such a motion, that it shall be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly corrupted and become Leven, like unto that which was put therein, and this Levened Paste shall turn another Paste into Leven, and this shall change another, and so infinitely. But the first Leven was made of the like Paste, and it can change nothing but Paste, into its own nature.</p>
                     <p>This change or conversion does evidently appear to be made by a motion, and agitation of the Parts of the Paste, that is to say, that the Leven which is sharp and penetrating (which may be sufficiently, known by the Smell) by the means of it's acid, or sharp
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206364:18"/>points, does enter into the Parts of the Paste, and in dilating and expanding them by the Motion, sets at liberty the Spirits which were in the Flower or Paste, and gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the adjacent Ethereal matter to enter into it, which joyning it self with those Spirits, does encrease the Motion, and drive the parts of the Leven yet further into those of the Flower, which thereupon are more divided, and this gives entrance to new Ethereal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and disengages new Spirits, that encrease the Motion more and more, and in fine, it does continue the same, until the Flower be very much divided, all the principles be in Motion, and receive a determination like, to that of their first mover, which was the Leven, and that was nothing else, as appears, but a Motion, Attenuation and Resolution of the Principles, which will be yet more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Example of Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Seeing Truth seldom appears on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; 'tis worth the while to observe what happens in the Generation and Multiplication of Vinegar. Wine is a Compound of five Principles. Of Spirit, Salt, Sulphur, Water and Earth, in such a Proportion, that the Spirits are predominant, and the rest of the Principles of a moderate quantity: If it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by any acciddent, that the Spirits evaporate, or that the acid of the Air (which the Wind
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206364:18"/>does often-times carry with it) does enter into the Vessel, or that heat alone does excite motion in this Wine, the Essential of Salt the Wine, which is naturally Acid (as we see in the Chrystal of Tartar) and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a fixt and a volatile, does more volatilise <hi>or raise</hi> it self, and being attenuated does <hi>dilate</hi> and expand it self over the whole substance of the Wine, and get the Mastery over the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which it does clog and bear down, yet not destroy, as some have pretended, but in vain, because, 'tis in no wise hard, at one Tryal to recal those Spirits from strongest Vinegar, provided it be made of Wine, and not of other <hi>Liquors.</hi> And 'tis by this exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its own essential Salt, which comes to be predominant over the rest of the Principles, that Wine is turned into Vinegar, which is a true Ferment that will turn a proportionable quantity of Wine into Vinegar, and this shall change another infinitely. That is to say, that there needs no more than one drop of Vinegar to turn all the Wine in the World into Vinegar, successively.</p>
                     <p>This being supposed, 'twill not, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, be difficult to compleat the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and shew, that the cause of the Pox is a Ferment, which ows it's original to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Seeds that are corrupted and Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:206364:19"/>
                     <p>I have said, at the beginning of this Treatise, that the most of those who get the Pox, have it by Tradition, or by Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from one another; and there, we did not meddle with the Manner of the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Ferment; but, because we would proceed, and search into it's first source, 'tis by this way of Reasoning we may find it out.</p>
                     <p>Experience does teach us that the Pox is an infectious Disease, which is communicated from one to another indefinitely, that it is the same in all, that 'tis cured with the same Medicine, and that consequently its Cause is aways the same, whence its Cause must be a true Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because nothing but that, does admit of these qualities.</p>
                     <p>And because Leven must be of the same kind with the Paste, the Venereal Ferment must necessarily be composed, of the same Matter of which the Persons therewith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected are composed.</p>
                     <p>The Seed is the first Matter of which Man is composed, the Seed has relation to all Parts of the Body, to the solid Parts, it being the foundation and basis thereof, to the Spirits, since it abounds with them, to the Blood, and other humors, because it does proceed from them.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:206364:19"/>
                     <p>The Seeds is very proper to degenerate into a Ferment, when it is corrupted in some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, because it does contain Principles that are very active, and fit to be exalted.</p>
                     <p>We cannot therefore find the Original of the Venereal Ferment, any where but in Seed that is much corrupted, nor is there any Seed that is corrupted, but in the Wombs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Women which keep company with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men. The Seeds of one Man and of one Woman only can never degenerate into a contagious and Venereal Ferment, seeing that according to the Laws of Nature, which is always uniform, if they take good care, those two Seeds, are afterwards capable of no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but for the Generation of a Natural <hi>Birth,</hi> or some other production, or, if some disposition be wanting for such a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, those Seeds are lost, but never produce any bodily harm, at least no contagious or Venereal distemper.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore somewhat else that is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required to make the Seed degenerate into a Ferment, that is Venereal, and altogether against Nature.</p>
                     <p>It shall therefore happen when a Common Woman has kept company with many Men, that their Seeds (which are of different, and often times of opposite qualities) being mixed in that womans Womb (which is naturally fitted to preserve the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206364:20"/>Seeds with all their Spirits) do forcibly justle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one another, and 'tis very hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but that in this Combat, some Spirits (with which each Seed abounds) shall vanish or be destroyed, and because the seeds have viscous Parts, the rest of the Spirits are entangled therein, whence there proceeds a mixture of Principles, and so great an Agitation and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of Parts, that the Salts that are in the Seeds are,
<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis by reason of the Salts with which the Seed abounds, that Voluptuous Men are called <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Sal,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> is said <hi>erta mari.</hi>
                        </note> by that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, exalted, and do expand themselves through the whole, and so prevail over the other principles which compose the Seed. And therefore this compound of several Seeds becomes a Ferment which is capable of corrupting other Seeds, and all the Parts of the Body, by reason of the relation they have to the Seed; and 'tis this Ferment which is to be called Venereal, because it is the cause of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper by a peculiar determination which it received in that corruption, that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it to exert it's force in one certain manner only, as we have shewn in Vinegar, which proceeds from the corruption of Wine, that is, from the resolution of the Principles of Wine.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:206364:20"/>
                     <p>And seeing Milk, which has a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of Seed, becomes easily Acid, by the exaltation of its own Salt, we have reason to believe, that in the present Case, the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that proceeds from the corruption of Seeds and the exaltation of their own Salt is also of the nature of an Acid.</p>
                     <p>Reason and Experience will confirm this opinion, if after great <hi>Sylvius de Leboe's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we make some reflection on Acids, and upon the Principal Symptoms of the Pox.</p>
                     <p>We have said, that the Principal Symptoms of the Pox were the Chancres, Ulcers, Heat of Urine, Bubo's, Pains, Nodes, Glands, Scabs, Tetters, and the Rottenness or Caries of the Bones.</p>
                     <p>'Tis evident that these Symptoms can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from none other, but a cause that is sharp, biting and coagulating, for the Chancre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ordinarily with a hardness, that denotes the coagulation of some juice, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Ulcer, and this is made by corrosion. In heat of Water, there is an Inflammation, Pain and Ulcer which shews an Acrimony, the Nodes and Glands proceed from the thickning and coagulation of some Liquors thatly all along the Bones, and in the Glands, with which our Bodies abound. The Itching that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Scabs and Tetters does manifest the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:206364:21"/>sharpness of Salt to be the cause, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosion of the Bones does prove the same.</p>
                     <p>All sharpness does proceed from Salt; This Proposition is general, and 'tis very easie to prove it; for of the five Principles which we reckon'd in mixt bodies, Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water and Earth, there is not one but Salt, that by it's Points and stiffness, is capable of Acrimony; the Spirit being very subtile and swift, Sulphur exceeding sweet and unctuous, Water very soft, and Earth without Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>'Tis thought with good reason, that all Salts are Originally Acid; but because it does not belong to the present Subject; 'tis to no purpose for me to discuss that proposition; 'tis sufficient that there are solid grounds, upon which we should admit a Salt; of whatsoever kind it be, as the Principal Salt of all, and a Principal most simple, and which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately United to the Principles of mixed Bodies (which cannot be perfectly resolved by any Chymical Art) is the cause of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Salts that are acknowledged at this day, and are drawn from mixed Bodies. But how different soever these Salts are, they are nevertheless reduced to two sorts, which are, an Acid and Alkali, the proportionable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof makes a third which is called Salin, and however the matter has been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206364:21"/>before this time, the Salts that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be in an Animal are reduced to these two. And upon this account (that we may return to our Subject) we may say, that all Acrimony depends on one of these Salts, <hi>viz.</hi> an Acid, an Alkali, or a Salt that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of these two.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may determin, if the Salt that produces the Acrimony of the Venereal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an Acid or an Alkali, 'tis necessary to make the following reflections.</p>
                     <p>The Essential Salt of Bread and Wine, which is the Principal Aliment we use are Acids, common Salt with which our Victuals are seasoned is Acid, the essential Salt of Fruit and Plants which we eat, is Acid, the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomach is Acid, the essential Salt of the Chyle is Acid, that of Milk, which in all appearance is nothing but Chyle, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and therefore that of the Seed must be the same: whence 'tis probable, that when the Seed is Fermented by the exaltation of it's own Salt, it does become Acid, and therefore the Venereal Ferment must be so too.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that 'tis possible for the Salt of the seed not to be Acid, because so many Concoctions that precede the generation of Seed, might entirely have changed the nature of the essential Salt, which was in the Aliment and in the Chyle; and in effect, we see that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:206364:22"/>Bile is made of the Food and Chyle, and yet it must be considered as an Alkali: but we must also observe, that Bile is nothing else but a Recrement, which is particularly made up of some parts of Salt and Sulphur, that have been scorch'd by the great heat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, and it principally proceeds from this strong heat, that a Salt, tho' first an Acid, is changed into an Alkali, it being thereby forcibly Joyned to a Terrestrial Matter; and yet it cannot be said, that the Seed is made up of a burnt Substance, since on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it ought to be the most gentle, pure and noble matter of the whole Body; and therefore if it is made by the means of an acid Ferment, 'tis necessary that this Acid remain in its Composition, although this does never appear but when the Spirits that are predominant therein, are as it were vanquish'd and fetter'd by the exaltation of its own essential Salt, which we affirm to be an Acid.</p>
                     <p>All this is lyable to many Objections, which with the Answers thereunto would take up too much time. They who are not willing to acquiesce in the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> may if they please, suspend their Judgment, and if they will be at the pains to examine it, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires, they will <hi>grant me this at least,</hi> that although what is proposed by way of objection may be true, yet that (in all cases)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:206364:22"/>would not change the System, nor force of other Proofs.</p>
                     <p>The effects of the Venereal Ferment do manifest that it is Acid, since 'tis evident that it does condense and coagulate the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours excites sharp and piercing Pains, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Flesh, Membranes and Bones, as much almost, as other Acids; and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any blackness or gangrene; whilst that corrosion or corruption that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Alkalis's is always attended with a blackness, mortification and a gangrene, as in the Plague, the reason whereof is, that since an Alkali is produced by the force of Heat, it is by so much the more Fiery and Caustic as the Heat from which it did proceed, was violent. And therefore it is to be consider'd as a potential Fire.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless it does not follow, but that a gangrene may sometime seise such Parts as are infected with the Venereal Distemper, when the Body is much heated, abounds with Choler, and is under a Fever at the same time, but especially when one is careless of himself, or takes hurtful Medicines, as we have seen some Patients who had fallen into ill hands, but that happens by accident, the Acid of the Venereal Ferment being in less quantity or weaker then the Bile which is an Alkali: for in that Case the Alkali is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:206364:23"/>and being irritated by the Acid, does produce Effects contrary to those of the Acid.</p>
                     <p>And likewise, 'tis from this various Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Alkali and Acid, and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent proportion, whether it be in quantity or vigour, that we see in the Venereal Distemper, so great a Variety of Symptoms, and are frequently mistaken in our Judgment about the nature of that Disease, and the effect of the proper Medicines: wherefore 'tis needful to make our Observations with great care and consideration, and not to imagine that all Patients are to managed after a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>'TIS sometime easy enough to discover the Pox, especially if one has had some experience: but it often falls out, that the Signs which appear are so obscure, ambiguous and equivocal, that it is very difficult, and frequently impossible (even for the most judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and experienced) to know it.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:206364:23"/>
                     <p>From thence it is, that so many Impostures flow. The number of those who pretend to Cure this Distemper, is so considerable in the World, that there is scarce one, even to the most whifling Journey-man Apothecary, but gives himself out for an <hi>Able Man</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; from which we may conclude, that for one of sufficient Skill in these Affairs, you may find many thousands that know lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing; and there are not a few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, who are governed by their Interest, and who, in expectation of <hi>Half a Guinea,</hi> will perswade those that consult them, that they have the Pox, and having <hi>gained their point,</hi> treat their Patients with a thousand Sham-Offices, that are unworthy of the Character of a Man of Honour, who would rather choose to starve, or never gain one penny during his Life, then Affront the most inconsiderable and poorest Creature in the World. The Sick who know not their own Condition, or who oftentimes are ashamed to make it known to those who could Assist them, become a Prey to those <hi>Ignoramuses,</hi> or to those <hi>Cheats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am resolved, in this Chapter and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where on all occasions, to lay down the most certain Rules, by which the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may be discerned, that the Ignorant may learn to know it; and I shall give wholesome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:206364:24"/>Counsel to those who have had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to get this Disease, that they may shun the Ignorant, and avoid all Imposture.</p>
                     <p>Heat of Urine is not hard to be discerned in Men; 'tis somewhat more difficult in Women. Of this we shall treat in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it self, and therefore, that we may neither be tedious, nor repeat what has been said already, the Reader may consult the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Places.</p>
                     <p>We shall also speak of a Bubo or Poulaine, by themselves; in one of the following Chapters.</p>
                     <p>As for the Chancre, as it is considered as a particular Pox, we shall treat of it in a Chapter apart, which 'tis needful to read, in order to get a clear and solid Notion of it.</p>
                     <p>I suppose also, that the Reader remembers what was said in the fourth Chapter of this Treatise, for his help to distinguish the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pox, from the Universal; The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of the Venereal Distemper were described there, which as I think was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained, so far as to prevent mistakes about it; it being observable, that in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cases we must always prescribe some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies by way of precaution, provided they be no ways hurtful to the Patient.</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:206364:24"/>
                     <p>For Example, a Nurse, by giving suck to an Infant that has the Venereal Disease, has got a Chancre in one of her Breasts, and has had it for some time, never thinking of it nor dreaming of a Cure: Although you have no manifest signs that this Chancre has infected the Mass of Blood; nevertheless seeing it is very hard to conceive, but that some Particles of the Ferment have glided into the Blood; 'tis Prudence not only to mind the particular Cure of the Chancre, but also to prescribe some Medicines for cleansing the Blood, as some doess of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> mixed with a Purgative that is proportioned to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; or some slight Diet, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, we shall treat thereof in the Chapter concerning the universal Cure, and that of the Chancre.</p>
                     <p>And this is a Rule that is very useful in the Cure of the particular Pox, that is, which does only effect one Part.</p>
                     <p>As we must notneglect the Remedies of Precaution, for the depuration of the Blood (which may have received some Particles of the Venereal Ferment) during the time that necessary Medicines are applyed to the Part affected.</p>
                     <p>So we must not proceed to the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy so long as we have no certain marks of the Universal Pox.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:206364:25"/>
                     <p>I call that the great Remedy which does cause a Salivation, which I believe to be most natural and proper for curing the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pox.</p>
                     <p>I shall now give the Rules concerning the Universal Pox.</p>
                     <p>When a great number of Signs do appear, as a Chancre, Heat of Urine, Pains in the Night, Nodes, Glands, Scabs, Chancrous Ulcers and others mentioned in the description of the Venereal Distemper, in the Second Chapter; every one may know it to be the <hi>Pox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be a Chancre and Botch in the Groyn, one whereof does follow upon the other, it is a sign of the Universal Pox; for 'tis very evident, that such a thing cannot happen, unless the Mass of blood be infected, according to what we said, in the Fourth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis the same, when there is Heat of Urine and a Chancre, or heat of Urine and a Poulaine or Botch in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>If one of these three, a Chancre, heat of Urine, or a Poulain is accompanied with some other Sign, as some Nodes, Glands, Pains, Scabs, virulent Tetters, Caries of the Bone, 'tis a Mark of the Universal Pox.</p>
                     <p>And also when there is no Chancre; Heat of Urine, or Poulain about the Person, if it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:206364:25"/>appear that he was either neglected or ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; if any of those Accidents supervene, as Pains, and especially about the middle of the Arms or Legs, a great Scab, that is no ways like to an ordinary one, but especially, if it happen on the Head, or any virulent Ulcer without an external Cause it may be believed to be the Pox.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, a Woman may have her Whites, which may be taken for a virulent Gonorrhea, and she may have at the same time Pains, which yet shall not consequently be the Pox; and therefore on such Occasions, 'tis needful to proceed wisely in Business, and study the Discourse I shall make anon, of the Heat of Urine.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Chancre in the secret Parts or Breasts, and also elsewhere, which is dryed up, either by it self, or by Medicines, and that Chancre, after a considerable time, come again in the same place, without any manifest Cause there is some reason to beleive that the Pox has passed into the Mass of Blood; but if the Chancre return in another place, though never so near to the first, 'tis so without all doubt.</p>
                     <p>When the Body is covered with Blisters, and these Blisters are turned into Chancres, that is to say, into round Ulcers, the sides whereof are hard, and the middle somewhat
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:206364:26"/>white, or (as they say) resembling the Eyes of a Partridge, there needs no other proofs to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us of the Pox.</p>
                     <p>Pains alone over all the Body in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Members or Limbs, or Nodes or Scabs on the Head, which happen after keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company with infected Persons, are Marks of the Pox.</p>
                     <p>If Pains be in the Joynts, it requires a more strict Examination, and the Patient ought not to be treated, as if he had the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, unless there be a Concurrence of more evident Signs, because that may be a single Gout, and the same is to be said of a Rheumatism.</p>
                     <p>And herein 'tis very easie to be mistaken, for the Pox is often concealed under the Name of the Gout and Rheumatism. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, so long as there are no other Signs, as Chancres, Virulent Ulcers, great Scabs, Nodes, or the like, though the Pains hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after an unclean Conversation, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is not to be exposed to the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>And the Nodes that lye near the Joynts in Gouts, give an Assurance of the Pox, if they are not accompanied with other Signs; for such Nodes are often seen in Gouty Persons, who are not liable to the least suspicion of having the Pox.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:206364:26"/>
                     <p>An intollerable Pain, and such as has not yielded to ordinary Means, has passed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the Pox; but in that case 'tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some Asiurance that the Party has had some Chancre or Heat of Urine for a long time, from whence it is concluded that the Pox did proceed.</p>
                     <p>But upon such Occasions as that, he who knows himself to be under those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, does very little tender his own Health, if he do not consult with the most able Men, and those whose Profession it is to cure the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper, will have no sense of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Conscience, if they do not, upon mature Deliberation, undertake his Cure.</p>
                     <p>And because from this Case, which does often happen (as may be seen in such Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises as contain Medicinal or Chyrurgical Consultations) I draw a General Rule for the Patients, and those who cure them.</p>
                     <p>I say that no Person ought to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as having the Venereal Distemper, so long as no convincing Signs thereof do appear; otherwise, this were to undertake the Cure without knowing the Disease, and pretend to restore a Man to Health, without any Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he is sick.</p>
                     <p>'Tis better, whenever the Signs are not certain, to stay till some one does appear, that determines the thing, and if there be any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:206364:27"/>Grievances that do absolutely require some Help, they are, in my Opinion, to be looked upon as single, and it a Purgative be needful, <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> may serve the turn, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an harmless Medicine, which never has any bad Effects, if it be prepared, prescribed, and given as it ought.</p>
                     <p>And if the Mass of Blood be sensibly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, it may be depurated by easie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and gentle Medicines, such as promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Transpiration without excessive heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body, for which purpose, at this day, we safely use the Volatile Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or Vipers themselves, or the like.</p>
                     <p>There are also some Cases, in which 'tis better to use gentle Means, when we are not fully assured of the Venereal Distemper.</p>
                     <p>As for Example, After one has been cured in appearance of some Chancre or Heat of Urine; if Weariness without Labour, Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all manner of Food, an Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Venereal Action do follow, there is great probability that some Virulency is transmitted to the Mass of Blood; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, seeing these, when single, are but doubtful signs, and may very well be the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of some other Distemper, I think, he should be very precipitant, who would sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this Person, and that therefore, gentle Means (as we have said) are more preferable.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:206364:27"/>
                     <p>As also, if nothing appears but some Piles or Warts in the secret Parts, without any other sign, 'tis not to be thought the Pox, because these Accidents in that place do ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Decay and Weakness of those parts through a long and frequent use of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.</p>
                     <p>But if, together with such signs, there be some Fissures, which come towards the <hi>Anus,</hi> Chancrous Hemorrhoids, and Warts in other places of the Body; in such a Case, there is sufficient assurance of the Distemper.</p>
                     <p>If there be Chancres, with a Caries of the Bone, in the Palate or Nostrils (I mean such Chancres as are perceived in Persons who have the Venereal Distemper, which differ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much from those that are called Cancers) 'tis called the Pox, which is also very hard to be cured, as we shall shew in the Chapter that treats of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Line of Pimples that cross the Fore-head, which begins with the Impression that the Hat does make, and which does not disappear with a Scab on the Fore-head, Face, or Head, or Spots in other places of the Body, provided it be known that the Party has had some ill Conversation, it may be said to be the Universal Pox.</p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:206364:28"/>
                     <p>I saw lately a Sea-man, who, after having had a Venereal Chancre for the space of three Years, of which he was ill cured, became full of Glands or Tumors, some of which broke in his Neck and Breast, just as the Kings Evil, with no other difference, but that his was the Venereal Kings-Evil.</p>
                     <p>We frequently see Persons who have their Bodies covered all over with Tetters, very large and thick Crusts, if they have had any Conversation with Persons infected, or lay in Bed with them, or in their Linnen that is made Contagious by their Sweat, it is the Universal Pox.</p>
                     <p>I have seen a young Woman, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known a Man, and who was covered all over her Body, the Privities only excepted, with those Crusts of an Inch thickness, and as broad as ones Hand, without knowing that she had laid with any suspected Woman; she could not be cured for the space of three years, though during that time, some who passed for famous Men, prescribed Medicines to her. I cured her with Bathes, Whey and Mercury, without Salivation, and within seven Months she perfectly recovered, and no Tetter or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accident has ever returned, though it be now fourteen years since she was cured. And from that time, I have been more confirm'd in the Opinion I had, that Mercury is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:206364:28"/>Remedy for Tetters and the Scab; I also give it on the like Occasions, at all times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when the Scab is more obstinate then ordinary, and to have the Cure the more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily done, during all the time that I was Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian to the Hospital of St. <hi>James,</hi> I have us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with good success, a Mercurial Purgative for those that had the Scab.</p>
                     <p>I brought that Example of the Maid, only to shew, that there are some Cases that require the use of Mercury, though there be no Pox at all in the Case, or when we are least assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it, and especially when we see that Mercury is otherwise a proper Medicine for the Symptom that is apparent, and when we observe that ordinary Means do no good, whence also an Indication may be drawn, if the Symptom be not Venereal, it may at least appear to be such as requires almost the same Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not pretend that this Indication is either general or certain, and I am not, in this, in <hi>Mercurial</hi>'s Mind, in other respects, a very great Physician, who says in his third Chapter, concerning the Venereal Distemper, That when the Disease does not yield to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicines, nor to those that the Antients have taught us, 'tis in effect, a sign (as he says) that 'tis the Pox.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:206364:29"/>
                     <p>On the contrary, I am of the Opinion, that every thing should be examined, all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances exactly weighed, and a prudent Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration used, that nothing be undertaken but upon weighty reasons, and if, after all the Efforts that are made for knowing the Truth, no signs shall appear, that may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Distemper to be Venereal, 'tis not to be medled with <hi>under that Name,</hi> without knowing it <hi>to be of that Nature.</hi>

                     <p>AFter that which we have said in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapters, it will not be difficult to find what is the Prognostic of the Pox, for after having examined if the Pox be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal (which makes it the more hard to be cured) or contracted since ones Nativity; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Difficulties which may arise from the Constitution, Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by considering what was said in the Fourth Chapter, concerning its different Degrees; it will be easie to judge, that it is so much the more difficult to cure, as it is the more rooted in the Body: And therefore, seeing the last Degree is that of a Caries or Rottenness of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:206364:29"/>Bones, 'tis also that which is most hard to be cured, especially when that Caries is in the Skull or Nose: I will also say that 'tis so difficult, that the Cure thereof ought not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any use of bare Mercurial Pills; and the outward use of Mercury by Friction, is to no purpose, because it never reaches the Caries of the Bones, that it may destroy or remove the Venereal Ferment that adheres to those parts.</p>
                     <p>I know by Experience, that the surest Course that can be taken about this kind of Pox, is by way of Vapour, which does reach the infected Bones; but seeing this Method is somewhat dangerous, and may have ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, it requires both Judgment and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity to accomplish it.</p>
                     <p>The Venereal Distemper is not commonly Mortal; there have been some who have had it for the space of thirty years or more, and when they dye, it does not so much proceed from this Disease, as from others which were contracted through the Disorder that is made by the Venereal Ferment, which does so much corrupt the Humors, that it hinders the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment and other bodily Functions, or when it disgorges it self on some noble part, it does so corrode and corrupt it, that the Loss is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable, whence it comes to pass, that in such a Case, Death is unavoidable.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:206364:30"/>
                     <p>It frequently happens, that the most part of those who have the Venereal Distemper, do not suffer themselves to be dealt with to good purpose, and that upon a great many Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Some are thus backward, because they have not enough to pay for their Cure; others, because their Estate or Business do not permit; a third sort, because they are guided by Physicians who have no Skill, or if they have, yet may be mistaken, though they were the most able Men in the World, seeing the Pox is sometimes so concealed, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to know it in all its Circumstances. There are some Bodies of such singular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, that Mercury cannot produce the desired Effect upon them, notwithstanding all the Precaution and Means can be used; those who have Practice in these Matters, know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that they cannot perform a Cure at the first, especially those who make use of Mercurial Oyntment; there have likewise been some, whom Salivation by Friction could never work upon; 'tis true, that at this day, 'tis advised, when these Difficulties do occur, that we should make use of a Dose of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis,</hi> that the Salivary Vessels may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to open.</p>
                     <p>But I could wish that it were an easie Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to raise a Salivation, by the Means of the Unguent, and if so, can any one be assured that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:206364:30"/>a sufficient Quantity of the Mercury shall enter into the Body, to excite a Salivation to that degree which is requisite, or that it shall not enter in too great a Quantity, so as to cause a Suffocation, or some other Catastrophe, which shall be worse than the Disease.</p>
                     <p>I am of the Opinion, that it is impossible to be exact in this Matter, because, as we shall shew in the Chapter of the Cure, it does depend on the Disposition of the Skin (which in some, is too much shut, and in others too open, whence it does admit of a greater or lesser quantity of the Mercury that is in the Unguent) and not on him who applies the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, how well soever he may observe the Rules.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it often falls out, by reason of some of those Faults I have shewn, that the Venereal Distemper is not cured, but only its Symptoms, and that some of the Venereal Ferment does still remain in the Body, which in process of time, does lodge and entangle it self in the Humors, in such a manner, that some Inconveniences do afterwards ensue, which do not resemble the Pox, though they have in effect sprung from it as their proper Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>From thence it is, that there are so many hereditary Diseases, so many scrophulous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, so many old Ulcers, so many Gouts and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:206364:31"/>Rheumatisms, so many white Courses amongst Women; and in a Word, from thence arise the most part of those Diseases which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in Families, and which unhappily have only ordinary Means applied to them, because their Source is concealed, and the Physicians themselves many times, dare not be inquisitive concerning their Original.</p>

                     <p>NOT to stand upon the Etymologies that Authors have given of Mercury, nor the different Names that it has got, nor the Influence which it receives (as is thought) from the Planet Mercury, nor the places where it is found; I only say, that Mercury or Quick-silver is a Metallic Liquor, the Nature whereof is as wonderful as it is singular for it is extreamly heavy, seeing it comes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near to the weight of Gold (which is the most ponderous Body of any we know, and that which may be called the most fixed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too, because it does resist the Fire more then all others) we may add, that it has a nearer Affinity to Gold than any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:206364:31"/>because it does more easily unite it self to it than to other Bodies, and goes as to a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, a considerable way, to find it, which has been matter of admiration, that there should be a Sympathy of a most active and moveable Body, with another that is of all Bodies the most fixed.</p>
                     <p>And yet the least Action of the Fire makes this Liquor extreamly swift, volatile, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. Mercury is a gross Body, seeing it is very opacous, and it is exceedingly subtile, seeing it does penetrate the Pores of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; those of the Vessels that contain it, when ever the Fire does work upon it, and those of Gold, which are incredibly small, by reason of its compactness; and which is more, it does produce surprising and quite opposite Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; it heats sometimes, and does cool at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times; it does purge some by Salivation, others by Stool, and a third sort by Transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and as though it were never the same thing, one Man is purged at one time with six Grains of Mercury, who at another time cannot be purged with thirty Grains.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis this great Unconstancy and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Mercury, that has very much perplexed, to no purpose, the Heads of very able Men, who endeavour'd to explain its Nature, and give some regular Definition thereof; upon which account, I have sometimes said, by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:206364:32"/>that in this Matter, 'tis needful to follow <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Precept very closely, who said, That

                     </p>
                     <p>If Mercury be a Bank that splits the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned, and a Stone of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to so many curious Men, who are assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous in making new Discoveries, and more especially, to draw an universal Medicine from this Metallic Liquor, without knowing its Nature: What can the more Ignorant pretend, who know nothing of it, unless it be some pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Receit, to sublime or precipitate the same with a Corrosive (which they can never any more separate) or barely to mix it with Purges or Oyntments, and with this they would pass for Workers of Miracles. 'Tis indeed an Abuse, and one ought to use Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if he cannot know the Nature of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury to the bottom, to find out a Method, whereby it may be, in such a manner prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it may be given without danger. For if we examine the ordinary Receits thereof that are found in Authors, we shall find that all of them give us the same Song, which they borrow from one another, and that none of them does examine what he proposes to us, which will be more manifest, after I have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:206364:32"/>delivered my Opinion of Mercury, and my Experiments upon using it.</p>
                     <p>Although Mercury is an homogeneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it is as easie to separate the Principles that compose it, as those of Gold, though this principal Metal does contain such as are very closely united and well digested, and those of Mercury are not so strongly joyned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is only a crude, imperfect and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested Metal, or rather a Substance that comes somewhat near to a Metal; nevertheless, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Experience do evince that it does contain such Principles.</p>
                     <p>First, a great deal of Salt, but not an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly, as some pretend (for there was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such found in the Mines) but an exceeding Acid Salt, very like that which is in Sulphur Mineral, which is known by distilling it by it self, by a Method that all Chymists are well acquainted with; for it is resolved into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Liquor, as the Acid of Sulphur drawn off <hi>Per Campanam,</hi> which would not happen, if the Salt of Mercury were an Alkali, from which there can never be so much as one drop of an Acid drawn, seeing they are opposite. And this is an evident proof of my Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Notwitstanding what has been last said, Mercury may sometimes Operate not unlike to an Alkali, but upon a quite different reason
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:206364:33"/>which is, because it's Salt is Fettered by a great deal of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis not to be questioned, but that there is much Sulphur in Mercury, not at all imflammable as the common Sulphur, but Mettallic, incombustible, and as pure Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as that of Gold; the Proof of which is, that there are no Mettals but do consist of Unctuous Parts, for 'tis their Oyl that makes them capable of extension; if then Mercury be a substance that has a near affinity to Mettals, as 'tis not to be doubted; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Unctuous Parts as well as Mettals. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience does plainly confirm this, for Mercury does easily mix with common Sulphur, Fat, Turpentine and Resins, by which it appears, that they consist of substances that are alike; but the resemblance it has of common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is yet greater, because, this having a great deal of an Acid Salt in it's composition, has a double relation to Mercury, that is to say, by it's Salt and by it's Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>There is also without all question, contained in Mercury a subtile and volatile Earth, a Metalic Water, which makes it Fluid, and a Spirit which is it's proper Mercury. I shall not stay to give the Proofs of a Matter that is so very conspicuous in it self.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:206364:33"/>
                     <p>We shall now endeavour to explain what is observable in Mercury, together with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which it does produce.</p>
                     <p>It is ponderous, because it abounds with Salt, and experience does shew, that Liquors are by so much the more heavy, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the more Salt; the same may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all sorts of Wood; which is sufficient to perswade us, that it is likewise Salt which makes Mettals ponderous. Some believe, that it is the Sulphur that does produce this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I also think, that this is not useless, but that it does much contribute thereunto, by uniting the Salt to the other Principles; but it cannot be the Principal cause thereof, because it self is very inconstant, and there are some Bodies which are surcharged with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which weigh nothing in comparison with others, which cannot be said of Salt.</p>
                     <p>And it will not evince the contrary, to say, that this great quantity of Salt which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, cannot be drawn either from Mettals or Mercury; for this reason does only prove our want of Skill, for we see, that in Glass, there is a great deal of Salt <hi>Kali,</hi> and yet it is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Flint, which they use for making of Glass, that it cannot be separated from it, by any ordinary Art, much less can it be done from Mercury, which flies away with the least heat.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:206364:34"/>
                     <p>It is Volatile, and the least fire does make it evaporate, because, seeing it is Liquid, the fire does easily penetrate into it, and divide it into such small Parts, that it can then raise it into Vapours, and reduce it into that State, in which it was at first; for Mercury is nothing but a Mettalic Vapour, which is raised by the Central heat of the Earth, and condensed in the Surface, by the external heat. It is true, that this Mercurial Vapour, meeting, in its way with some Sulphurs, with which the Mines abound, does, by joyning therewith, compose a mixture that makes the Mineral Cinabar, not unlike that we see in Artificial Cinabar, which is only a mixture of Sulphur and Mercury, that may be easily separated by putting filings of Iron into the Cinabar, and then distilling the whole in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort.</p>
                     <p>It is Opacous, because it has straight pores, and such as never can be disposed in a right Line, without changing the Nature of the Mercury, being composed of Spherical Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that are in a perpetual motion.</p>
                     <p>It is penctrating, because it does easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it self into Atoms, and is in a continual motion.</p>
                     <p>It resolves Tumours, and dissolves Phlegm, because it is penetrating, and composed of an Acid Salt and of Sulphur, which are very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:206364:34"/>proper dissolvents, because Phlegm contains much of an Acid, wrapt up in Unctuous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And therefore there is a great Affinity betwixt the one and the other: and Tumours proceed from a Phlegm, that is made thick and hard by an Acid, and therefore, the Mercury does dissolve it, and the resolution that afterwards happens, does proceed from the natural heat and motion, which does assist the Mercury in its Action.</p>
                     <p>It does produce cold Diseases in some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and is a great Enemy to the Brain and the Nerves, especially when it is taken crude or ill prepared, because it's Mettallic Sulphur, which is crude and indigested, and by the Action of heat draws other Parts with it, does turn into a Vapour, that always joyns with some Volatile Acid, which it finds in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and this Vapour, being carried through the Body, with the Blood, and especially to the Brain, does settle there, by reason of the coldness of that Part, as it does also stay in the Nervous parts, which are likewise cold; and fixing it self in their Pores does obstruct the passage of the Spirits, and stop their course; And hence it is, that those who take Mercury out of the Mines and who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Works, do commonly fall into a Palsey, by reason of the ill effects of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Vapours.</p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:206364:35"/>
                     <p>On the contrary, it does heat some others, by Accident, when it is unskillfully mixed with Purgatives, that are proper for causing heat, or when it is prepared with sharp In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, that make violent Irritations, which raise an Effervescence in the Humours; or when that Acrimonious preparation, and that Purgative have procured, without Discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a voidance of the serosities which were in the Blood; for in that Case, the Active Principles of which the Blood is composed, not being tempered and restrained by those serous Parts, making nearer approaches to, and being altered by one another, produce that great heat, which follows upon a Fermentation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature.</p>
                     <p>It does excite Salivation, because, when it has once entred into the Body, the heat does reduce it into a Vapour, and seeing there is an Acid in all sorts of Bodies, those Acids do easily joyn themselves to the Mercury, which in it self, does contain an Acid Salt, as we have said, and those Acids being in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therewith, make it Corrosive, in the same manner almost as the Acids of Vitriol and Sea. Salt do communicate a Corrosive quality to common Sublimate, which, as is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all, has no force, but by the points of Salt, which are joyned thereunto, in Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without being able to dissolve it entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:206364:35"/>for the Mercury does retain its round Eigure, as may be seen by a Microscope (and those Salts are by their Points, fixed in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Globs of the Mercury, end-wise,) so that the Mercury is the more easily carryed to the head, where it does, with no difficulty stay, by reason of the cold that it meets with there, and because it does joyn it self more readily to the Phlegm then to any other Humours, upon the account of the Acid which it contains, and the Salivary Vessels do always contain a Phlegm that is the matter of the Saliva, the Mercury does dissolve the same, and for that reason, it is more abundantly evacuated by the Salivary Vessels, and seeing the Phlegm does attract the Mercury, which is become Acid, as we have said, the extremity of the Salivary Vessels is Corroded, and likewise the mouth is thereby all Ulcerated, whence it comes to pass, that the Salivation or Flux is encreased, and that an extraordinary quantity of Phlegm, does Issue out of the mouth till the same Phlegm, by its continual Course, has wash'd these Ulcers, and drawn to it self the Mercury that had lodged there, and then, by degrees, it does occasion a closing and healing of the Salivary Vessels, which makes the Salivation to cease.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:206364:36"/>
                     <p>Sometimes Mercury does only Purge by stool, and 'tis thought, that, in such a Case, it does meet with some Alkalious Matter, which makes it let go those Acids, and precipitates the Mercury into the lower Parts, not unlike to what is observed, when Sublimate Corrosive, dissolved in common water, is precipated by the Oyl of Tartar, or by its Salt only, which I believe may be done; but I have observed, that it is more difficult to excite a Salivation in Melancholy Persons, then in those that are Choleric, or of any other constitution, and that those Melancholy Persons are frequently Purged by stool, which gives me ground to believe, that seeing those Persons abound in Acids, and that the Acids are more fixed in them, then in others, those same Acids may very well stop the Mercury, and hinder it from ascending to the head, whence it comes to pass, that being more heavy, because sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with those fixed Acids, it is forced to pass by stool; so we see, that when there is a dissolution of Mercury made with Acids, as the Spirit of Sulphur, the Spirit of the Oyl of Vitriol, of Allom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> those Acids are the more fixed, and the Mercury is sublimed with the greater difficulty, and if it be taken at the mouth after a convenient Dulcoration, it does Purge more by stool then by Vomit, and is not proper to cause Salivation.</p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:206364:36"/>
                     <p>It does, without doubt, proceed from the defect of those Acids, that the Mercury not finding enough thereof, to make it sublime to the Head, or to precipitate it downwards, is carried off by Transpiration only, and that there are some Persons who can neither be Flux'd nor Purged with Mercury.</p>
                     <p>From thence it is also, that one may be well Purged with a small quantity of Mercury, at one time, and that a considerable quantity thereof shall have no effect upon him at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, for there is not the same quantity of Acids in the Body, at all times, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Diet, the Season and the Passions, together with many other circumstances which every one may easily observe.</p>
                     <p>From which we must conclude, that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury does act in so many different manners, according to the different dispositions of the Person who receives it, or the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it's preparation.</p>
                     <p>And finally, it is from thence that we are to draw a Consequence, that is the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of all others, that those who adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give Mercury, without knowing it's right Preparation and the effects which it is capable to produce, as well as the Constitution of their Patients, do a great injury to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and a greater to the Sick, whom they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:206364:37"/>unhappily expose to a great number of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Dangers which they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, so long as they are not capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>It remains, that we examine, whether Mercury be a Specific Remedy for the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal distemper.</p>
                     <p>A Specific Medicine is that which does cure a certain Disease, at all times, in all places, in all ages, and in all degrees; and seeing we have shewn, that the Venereal Ferment is of an acid Nature, that it fixes on the Phlegm particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be said, that Mercury is the most fit Remedy of any we have yet known, for the Cure of the Venereal Distemper; for if it is not become absolutely incurable, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Person who is subject thereunto, as by the Corruption of some noble Part, or the Complication of some mortal Disease, I believe it may be compleatly Cured; but seeing I have made it appear that Crude Mercury is very dangerous, as well as that which is Corrosive; the former, because it is an Enemy to the Brain and all the Nervous Parts, as we have formerly shewn; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by Irritations, Corrosions and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations which it makes in the Stomach and elsewhere; I can Advise no body to use either of them, although I know very well, that some have been Cured both by the one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:206364:37"/>and the other, because those Cures were causal, and if there happens to be Success at one time; the Sick are nevertheless always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to danger, or to the fury of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accident worse then the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper; I shall make this more manifest in the following Chapter, in which I shall shew the common way of using Mercury, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having demonstrated the danger that is apparent upon such a manner of using it, and the small assurance that one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself, of curing the Sick that way, I shall establish another Method which may be practised at all times, and is incomparably more gentle, more easy and more certain.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, although this Method has many Advantages above the common way, yet the Sick are exposed thereby to some inconveniences, when Salivation is to be excited, which ordinarily cannot be so effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that there will be Ulcers in the Mouth, tho' we have sometimes seen gentle and protracted Salivations without any ill Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Mouth, which proceeded from a good management of the Mercury; and the like Success may happen by taking what time is needful for the Cure.</p>
                     <p>But seeing there is no better Medecine; known then that, and that all others that have been hitherto used, are ineffectual, or in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:206364:38"/>all Cases, tedious and most dreadfully trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, we are forced to use it. We may also say, that Mercury is an admirable Medicine for many other Diseases; the wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that we perceive every day of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> does prove the Excellency of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and there are so many Able Men at this day who make Experiments on Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, that we may reasonably hope, that some or other of them will at length, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the World, some extraordinary preparation thereof, which will make it manifest that Mercury is a soveraign Remedy for the Venereal Distemper; whilst I expect this, I shall ingenuously declare, that having of a long time observed the different Effects produced by Mercury (that is prepared a thousand ways) in a great Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons subject to the Venereal Distemper, whom I have cured; I have found by Experience that <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> sublimate is a Remedy that will never do any hurt, if one knows how to use it, but it is also so weak, that how little soever the Pox has taken root, it is not to be expected that it can be cured thereby; yet there are some Persons of so delicate a Constitution, and whose Humours are so fluid, that they may be Cured with twenty or thirty Doses thereof, provided it be mixed with a Purgative, and convenient Vehicles. I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:206364:38"/>have often, on such occasions, prescribed this Receit.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> sublimate well prepared, and the Powder of Vipers, of each six Drachms, Cristal of Tartar in fine Powder, and Scammony in Powder, of each half an Ounce, the Trohisicks of Alhandal, two Drachms, mix them altogether with so much Powder of Pale Roses as may suffice to make up a Mass of Pills, whereof a Drachm is to be taken, or one Drachm and a half, with your ordinary Diet, Exercise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have also found by Experience, that we may use with very good Success (even in the case of an inveterate Pox) the Golden Precipitate, the preparation of which is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take one part of fine Gold, and three parts of Mercury revived from Cinabar, make an Amalgam of both in the ordinary form, and put this Amalgam in a fit matras, well luted, digest them over a fire, with a gentle heat at the first, that the Mercury do not ascend and separate it self from the Gold, encrease the fire by little and little, till all the Mass shall be changed into a Red Powder, and which will become of a dark red Colour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continuance of the heat: That it may be well done, it is necessary to digest the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for three Months together, after which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:206364:39"/>it will be sufficiently fixed, so as it may be safely given. The Dose is from three to twelve Grains for the strongest Persons, mix it with a convenient Purgative, for Example, with the Polychrest, or the Catholic Pills.</p>
                     <p>I cannot enough extol the Vertues of this Medicine, and he who shall use it skilfully, will not repent the time he bestowed in the digesting of it, and no sooner shall he have made the Experiment of its Vertue, but he will reject all other Receits which are found in Books.</p>
                     <p>It does ordinarily purge by Stool, and sometimes by Vomit, it must not be washed before it is used, otherwise it will loose some of its Acrimony which was communicated to it by the fire, without which it will not purge as it ought.</p>
                     <p>It may be taken every third day, unless the Patient have a Loosness or Purgation in the Morning in which it is to be taken; in which case, it is to be given on another day when it is stopp'd; in the Intervals the Patient must be let Blood less or more, according as his Blood abounds, or is corrupted.</p>
                     <p>When there are Nodes or Tetters, or the Body is dry, Bathes must be used, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollition of the Parts, for humectation and encreasing of the fluidity of the Humors, and bringing them to such a Condition,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:206364:39"/>as they may easily yield to the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>All the difficulty is to determine, what Number of Doses is requisite to each Person that has occasion to use it, for although the Accidents have wholly disappeared, it does not follow, that the Patient is perfectly recovered, for there still remains some Ferment in the Parts, or in the Blood, from which the Pox will in a short time spring up again, when it has not been altogether rooted out, as we have sometimes seen, when we had less experience: And therefore to be sure, some Dose of the Medicine ought to be taken after all the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have quite vanished, that no Leven be left in the Blood; a Decoction of Vipers may be given for some days, by which means, there will be an insensible transpiration that shall carry off all the rest of the Venereal Ferment, and that shall so perfectly cleanse the Blood, that the Patient will be beyond the danger of a relapse. It is truly said,

And therefore, in this case, it is better to salivate the Patient, not by the means of an Unguent, which I would advise no body, because of its ill Consequences, which we shall shew in the next Chapter, besides that it cannot do any good in such an Exigency, for this reason, because the Mercury does not penetrate so far as the putrified Bone, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Ferment that infects it, but this Salivation must be procured by Fumigation or Vapour for which we shall shew the best method.</p>
                     <p>I leave all other Medicines which were used by the Antients, as <hi>Guiacum, Sarsa-parilla, Sassafras</hi> and <hi>China-root</hi> and also <hi>Box,</hi> which has been used of late, by some modern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, because no body doubts of the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of these Remedies, and every one is satisfied that there is no Cure to be expected from them, and they serve for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but to heat such Bodies, as require them, for attenuating the Phlegm, by making a Ptisan thereof, for their ordinary Drink.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the Method of Curing the Venereal Distemper, and that Salivation is the most short and the most certain way, provided that the</hi> Mercurial Unguent <hi>be not made use of to excite it.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT must be agreed upon by all, that the Pox may be cured by all such methods, as will effectually evacuate the Phlegm, in which the Venereal Ferment does particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ly, and which will depurate the Blood; And therefore, Sudorifics, Diuretics, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, Purgatives and Salivation are the means that are the most proper and convenient for that end.</p>
                     <p>But after all, I must freely declare, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these Remedies be all good, yet Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be preferred to all the rest, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best, the shortest, the surest, nay I will say, the most natural method: for if we observe the Oeconomy of our Body and the ways which Nature has provided for the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of superfluous Humours, we shall find that she voids the Excrementitious Matter that remains after the first digestion, with the more gross Parts of the Bile and the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Juyce, by stool; the superfluous Serosity (after it has served as a Vehicle for the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juice, with which all the Parts of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:206364:41"/>Body are nourished) partly by the Veins, and partly by insensible Transpiration; the menstrual Blood by the Matrix; the Hemorrhoid Blood by the Hemorrhoid Veins; some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Excrements by particular Passages, as by the Ears, the Hair, by Expiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, Lastly, as to the Pituit or Phlegm, the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary Vessels are appointed for the Evacuation thereof: The likeness that is betwixt the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit and Saliva is well known; They being the same Matter, and only differing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; for the Saliva is the first Matter of the Pituit, the Saliva is continually swallow'd down, and when it is in the Stomach, it grows thick, and in the digestions, it does intermix it self with the most Viscous Part of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and is afterwards carried into the Gut cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Duodenum,</hi> where it does continually mix it self with the Bile and the Pancreatic Juice, which make a Fermentation together, by the means of which it does so fall out, that the more gross Parts are precipitated, or forced downwards with the Excrementitious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be evacuated by stool, and the purer Part is carried by the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> to the Heart, and from thence, by the Arteries, to all the Body, with the Blood, from which it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually separated by the Conglomerated Glands that lye on either side of the <hi>Mandibulum,</hi> and from thence it is carried by the Salivary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:206364:41"/>to the Mouth, in which the Pituit that descends from the Brain, does mix with it, there being a considerable quantity thereof, produced in the Head, by reason of the coldness of that Part, which Pituit does insensibly pass through the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> from whence it is Filtrated, through the Pituitary Gland, into the Mouth, so that it is easie to comprehend how the Phlegm is carried from all places of the Body into the Mouth, and that by it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion; And therefore, in a Salivation, which is excited by Mercury, the Phlegm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in a quicker motion then ordinary, does easily draw to it self all the impurities of the mass of Blood, and especially the Venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ferment, because of its Acidity, as we have said elsewhere, and by that means the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>d is compleatly purified.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that it seems that the sweat may effect the same; which certainly would be so, if we had a Sudorific, that could without any violence, separate the Pituit from the mass of Blood; but seeing it is Viscous, it is very difficult, to reduce it into Vapours by any Remedies that we know, to the end that it may transpire through the Pores of the Skin; and if one will needs attempt it, he must heat the Body very much; whereas the Maxillary Glands have naturally a Consiguration fit for making this separation, which is enough (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:206364:42"/>using other reasons) to prove, that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Salivation is only an imitation and an Acceleration of the natural.</p>
                     <p>They also who are conversant about this Matter, know by experience, that it is more difficult to stop a Flux then to raise it, and therefore they who give it by the Unguent do always expose the sick to a mortal danger, because they cannot measure the quantity of Mercury, which ought to enter into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for puting that Pituit in motion, which is not precipitated, and opening the Pituitary Vessels by little and little; whence it does come to pass, that a great deal thereof does enter into them at once, which makes the Pituit and the rest of the Humours ascend to the Throat and Head, and produces Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are ready to choak the Pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, a thing which does very frequently fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l out; upon which account, every one concerned ought for the future, to think of such means for exciting Salivation, as may be gentle, and safe.</p>
                     <p>This did oblige me to apply my self with all diligence to search for another kind of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mercury then what is to be found in Authors, by the means of which I can excite a Salivation, by giving, at the most, half a Drachm thereof, to the strongest Person, in four or five Doses, which will also Purge by stool, and a little by Vomit, Urine and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:206364:42"/>and will give motion enough to the Phlegm to pass by the Mouth for as long a time, as when Salivation is excited by Friction, but in a manner that is imcompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more gentle, all the trouble which ensues upon Friction, being thereby avoided, which to speak the truth, is so great and intollerable (besides the danger to which the sick is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) that if those who have the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper knew the same, I am verily perswaded, that there is not one of them amongst a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but would rather choose to endure the Disease all his life time, though it should be never so short, then meddle with such a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Remedy.</p>
                     <p>That I may make it appear how intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that method is, I shall shew in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner those that have the Pox are commonly treated when they are to undergo Salivation by way of an Unguent.</p>
                     <p>I suppose that the Patient hath no other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease in complication with the Pox, which would require distinct Remedies, that ought to be first given, and that the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is only to come under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I do likewise suppose that the Person that is to undergo the Friction is of a good and strong Habit of Body, to engage with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, without any great Preparation, for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206364:43"/>correcting of the evil qualities that are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in his Blood.</p>
                     <p>Now the Patient is to be prepared, <hi>First,</hi> they give him a Glister to dispose him for bleeding; the next day they let him Blood; and afterwards repeat bleeding, according as the Patient is more or less Sanguine or Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. They purge him at least, three or four times, for carrying off the more gross Excrements; and after that, they Bathe him for eight or ten days, to make the humours fluid, to open the Pores of the habitude of the Body, and to make the Mercury pass more easily through the Skin. Some, for the better opening of the Pores, give a Sudorific, putting them three or four times in a Sweat, placing the Patient under a Canopy, archet, or any other Instrument proper for that purpose: And in the mean time, they give him a Ptisan to drink, to cause heat, and put the humours in Motion, and withal dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Diet gradually, till he be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Broths.</p>
                     <p>After that, they begin Friction, with the Mercurial Unguent, which they have prepared before: This Unguent is ordinarily prepared according to this form, or some other that may be reduced hereunto, buy putting more or less Mercury in it. Take six ounces of Quick-silver, beat it in a Marble Mortar, with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:206364:43"/>it's cover of Wood, with three or four ounces of fine Turpentine, when the Mercury is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, add thereto a Pound and a half of Hoggs-lard, and one ounce of the Oyl of Laurel; the Unguent must be beaten a long time, for dividing the Mercury, the beating being to last for the space of seven or eight hours, this is called the Gray, or Neapolitan Unguent, which is the same that the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries sell for the Scab, with this difference, that the latter has a less mixture of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>
                     <p>This Unguent is then taken, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a great fire, with a Screen before it, they make the Patient warm himself in his shirt, that the Unguent may make a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entrance, and they rub it on him, for that time, very well, from the Soles of his Feet to above his Knees, and from the Wrists, to his Shoulders, using in this Friction, two or three ounces of Unguent; after that, they put the Patient in a Bed very warm, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to keep very close and covered, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, before that, so ordered the Bed and all the Room, that the Air is shut out, and the wind can have no entrance, keeping a good sire on, by Night and by Day, even when the wheather is but moderately cold.</p>
                     <p>The next day following, they put the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in the same Posture, and making use of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:206364:44"/>a little more of the Unguent, they rub all his Body (the Head, the fore-part of the Breast and Belly being only excepted;) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commit him to his Bed warm as before.</p>
                     <p>On the third day, they repeat the same, and if they do not perceive the marks of an approaching Salivation, they continue the like method, by a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and if after all, the Signs of Salivation do not appear, they think it the best way (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of using more Frictions which may prove mortal) to give the Person, a small Dose of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> by the mouth, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min or begin the Salivation.</p>
                     <p>Then it is, that whilst the Mercury, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to the head, the Patient finds pricking Pains in his Mouth, which are followed with Ulcers therein. And because the Phlegm is ordinarily carried thither with a Rapid Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it does draw along with it self the other humours, which inflame all the Head and Throat, and put the Patient in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffocated: yet if the Salivary Vessels be opened, and the Pituit sufficiently Fluid, it does run swift enough, and two or three Pounds of the Saliva are every day evacuated at the mouth.</p>
                     <p>This Salivation, that it may answer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, ought to continue at the least for the space of fifteen, and at the most, thirty days; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:206364:44"/>during that time, the Patient is to eat nothing but Broth, some yolks of Eggs upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and a Ptisan made with <hi>Guiacum</hi> which is something offensive to the taste.</p>
                     <p>They give the Patient a Glister every other day, and sometimes Purge him gently, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the end of the Salivation, which being over, they give him a formal Purge, they let him again Blood, and put him to sweat, according as he is more or less dried by the Salivation.</p>
                     <p>To this it must be added, that the Patient is not to stir out of Bed, and that his Linnen must not be shifted for seven or eight days, and that he must wear the same shirt that he had on when the Friction was begun, which would be no matter of great hardship for some old Souldier, who might possibly wear a dirty and lousy one much longer time; but for those Gallants who pretend to neatness, I verily believe, that they need no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Pennance <hi>from the most rigid Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What has been said of this Matter, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be in a Mans Case; for, as to the Female Sex, if their monthly Courses do not proceed regularly, proper means are to be us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regulate them, before the Remedy be applied, and if the Woman be with Child, there are Measures to be taken, with regard to all particulars.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:206364:45"/>
                     <p>I also supposed, that the Persons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Friction, is of a good Habit and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be cured; for seeing by this Method, the Mercury has entred into the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proportion, and that this Entrance does depend upon the Disposition of the Pores of the Skin; It does frequently happen that those Pores are very much shut, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very small quantity of Mercury does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which not being capable to dissolve the Phlegm, which is over all the Body, does still leave some Venereal Ferments behind, upon which occasion the Pox does quickly appear again. And when the Pores are too large, a great deal of Mercury gets an entrance, which does attenuate the Phlegm with too great ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity, and draws it to the Head, and to the Salivary Vessels, with the other Humors, whence not only a danger of Suffocation does ensue, as we have said, but also this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated Motion does hinder the equal distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Mercury, through all the Body, and the resolution of the coagulated Humors, which the Mercury would otherwise perform therein; so that in this Case there can be no Cure any more expected; it is so far true, that a great or small quantity of Mercury does sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing in this Method; and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, it does not depend on him who does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Friction, to make it enter more or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:206364:45"/>less, as we have said, but wholly on the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Pores; whence we may draw this Consequence, that those who undergo a Method of Cure by the Unguent, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored but by accident, and that they are more obliged to their good Constitution than to the Physician who prescribes the Medicine.</p>
                     <p>That will not happen, if Salivation be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by taking Mercury at the Mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this case it may be entertained as long as it is thought necessary, and also augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we perceive that it is not copious enough.</p>
                     <p>This way of Salivation is not dangerous, because it is excited by little and little. It is more gentle, because there is one part of the Matter discharged, which the Mercury does evacuate by Stool, Vomiting, Urine and Transpiration. It is not troublesome, there being no need for all that dolorous Fatigue to which the Patient is exposed by means of the Unguent, and by this Method, he may get out of his Bed when he pleases. It is short, because this Remedy is given to all, and the time from the giving of the Mercury, to the appearing of the Salivation, being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily but six or seven Hours, is sufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Patient, if need be; and this Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is only some Bleeding, which is done to those who stand in need of it, and some
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:206364:46"/>Broth made of Herbs, to those who are of a hot Disposition of Body; the Salivation being once over, there is a Purge given with some Royal Ptisan, and the Work is done.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that when the Skin has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, some gentle Sudorific may be given by way of precaution, <hi>viz.</hi> a Glass of the Water of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> with a little Cinnamon Water, and some drops of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> to be drank every Morning, for three or four days together; Which is an admirable Remedy for procuring Sweat without any Trouble, in a manner that is the most gentle that can be imagined. If it be advisable to sweat more copiously, there may be six grains of the volatile Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers added thereunto.</p>
                     <p>This Method of procuring a Salivation by Mercury taken at the Mouth, is not unknown to able Men. It is also practised in places of greatest renown. Some make use of crude Mercury, which is extreamly dangerous, for Reasons mentioned else where; others, white Precipitate, which I do not believe to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, because it is prepared with <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the salt Spirits of which do unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so strongly to the Mercury, that they cannot, by any means, be again separated, though it may be sweetned with washing, and the Spirit of Wine, and may be also prepared
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:206364:46"/>without <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> but since I have not seen these Medicines tryed, and have great cause to suspect them, I will not determine any thing concerning them.</p>
                     <p>I only know, that <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, which some use, is not in the least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by reason of its preparation, which Experience has confirmed to be very good: But seeing it is necessary that a great quantity thereof be given to each Patient, there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been one Person that had the Venereal Distemper in the first Degree, who took more than six hundred Grains, before his Cure could be effected; I shall not make use of such a Remedy so long as I can make a Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with a Mercury that is more sweet than that, and in so small a quantity, that the Work may be very easily compleated, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifteen or twenty Grains, and at the most thirty, for the most robust Persons, in three or four Doses.</p>
                     <p>To make it appear that the thing is very easie, we must make the following Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which shall withal, most clearly contain all the Process that I use in my way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Mercury.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> to proceed upon sure Grounds, we must banish every thing that is sharp, for the Mercury does find enough of that in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of those who have the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:206364:47"/>there is also enough in all Bodies, which joyns with it, and gives it force enough to open the Salivary Vessels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Seeing Mercury is a great Enemy to the Brain, and to the nervous Parts, when it is crude or ill prepared, it must not be given crude, nay, not with a Purgative, which sends it off by Stool, for this is not the way to procure a Salivation, because it cannot be doubted but that there is a way to prepare it so, as it shall not be dangerous, as we see for example, in <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> which is known by Experience to be a harmless Remedy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in what manner soever Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury be prepared, it can never be so divested of its own Nature, but that it will always keep a Character of its first Form, which it can easily resume in all the ordinary Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that it is good to divest it as much as is possible, at least, as much as is necessary, that the Mercury may not be revived in the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That for this reason, the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry must be given in as small a quantity as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible; and it is to be observed, that when Friction is allowable, as it is in Persons of a good Constitution, there does very little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury enter into the Body, although the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> does contain much of it; and it is so far thus to be presumed, that there are some
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:206364:47"/>judicious Persons who have maintained an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that in this case, nothing but the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Vapor of the Mercury does enter into the Body, and if one had the Curiosity to gather the Mercury that remains in the Linnen, there would be the same weight found, that was put in the Unguent at the first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That although the Mercury be made fit to go to the Head, and raise a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation; yet this Salivation shall do no good, if it be not performed by such a motion as is called Critical; that is to say, that the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Matter must be separated from the Mass of Blood, that it must be conveighed out of the Body by the most convenient Passages, which will not happen, if the Mercury be not a double Mercury, which may exert its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity from all Quarters, and be distributed through the whole Body, in conformity to the motion of the Blood, that it may be in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to seize upon the Venereal Ferment in all the parts of the Body; and therefore we must think it to be much better, if we could joyn it inseparably by way of Fermentation, to some domestick Spirit, that is well acquainted with the Affairs of the House, to conduct it through all those Stages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When this is once effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, we shall only have a Medicine which will be more proper for Transpiration than
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:206364:48"/>for Salvation: And therefore there must be an Assistant that is no Stranger to this Kind, which must be made fit to produce all these necessary motions.</p>
                     <p>Ignorant Persons may imagine that I talk to be seen, and not to be understood; but Men of reason, who by Study and Industry, do in some measure know the Nature of the Subject about which I treat, will understand me at the first reading, and do me the Right to declare in my Favour, that it is not possible for me to explain more clearly and faithfully, the preparation of a Medicine of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>And for such Persons it is, that I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this Treatise; 'tis just, that they receive the Benefit of it, and that, in the mean time will invite others, by their Example, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and Study. <hi>Qui nucleum ex nuce vult excorticat nucem.</hi> i. e. He that would have the Kernel must crack the Shell. I further declare, that neither Ambition nor Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness moved me hereunto. What I offer has a Foundation in reason, which assisted me in the finding of it, and this reason is seconded by a very fortunate Experience.</p>
                     <p>By this means we may cure the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Pox, I have already excepted that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, where there is a Caries of the Bones of the Nose or the Skull. Yet we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:206364:48"/>think it sufficient. Nevertheless, from the time that I first discovered this Anti-vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Medicine, although I have cured a great number of those who had the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I have not yet had enough of such Persons, who had their Bones so very much putrified, as to afford me an Occasion of establishing by Experience, an absolute Assurance of the thing. No body, in these days, does suffer himself to be eaten to the Bones by the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Distemper, they look to it, in some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time, without exposing themselves to the Fatality of the last Degree, but because I have formerly seen many, even of this sort, who could not be cured, either by Mercurial Pills or Friction, which were given them with no small Rigour; I have, with good success, used on the like Occasions, a Fumigation or Vapour, with Turpentine or Balsam of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Crust of Bread in Powder, and a little Mercury, and thereby raised a happy Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceeding gently at the first. Yet this Method is not absolutely without Danger, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Sylvius de Leboe</hi> has said of it, that the Fumigation is the safest way; it is easie, by making the least Observation, to be of a contrary mind, and I shall demonstratively prove, that this Remedy cannot cure all sorts of Pox, and if another way can be found for curing the Caries of the Bones, I would not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:206364:49"/>advise any one to use this; but seeing this Method is not used in this Country, and there are very few who knows how to practise it, I shall no longer insist on it.</p>
                     <p>I do not here prescribe any particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for Infants, because I know they may be very well cured without salivation, by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use of Sublimate, or in all Cases, by that of the Golden Precipitate.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I particularly consider as yet, the Case of Women, who have irregular Courses, because we know by experience, that the Remedy I have given does infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Menstrua,</hi> and that it does not in the least divert Salivation: We have also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the same Remedy does provoke the Haemorrhoids in Men who are subject to them, without diverting Salivation.</p>
                     <p>And upon this account, it ought not to be given to Women with Child, for fear of an Abortion; but the Solar Precipitate is to be used, and that with great moderation and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in Case the Cure cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated before she is brought to Bed, by reason of her being near her Time, which will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Continuance of the Remedy, it may be conveniently done afterwards, and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to the Mother, the Child will be cured at the same time, if some Grains of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt of Vipers be given to it from time
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:206364:49"/>to time. Or the Mother may be salivated in that Case, if the Physician pleases.</p>
                     <p>There is no need of a separate Chapter for a Description of the Medicines that may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the ill Accidents that frequently follow upon Salivation, that is made by the mercurial Unguent which, to speak the truth, are so dreadful, that they are enough to strike us with Horror, when we read them in Authors. You may judge how intolerable they are to the Patients, and what a Tragedy they are to the Spectators: For if the Medicine be well ordered, there will no ill Accident ensue, there needs only a common Gargarism to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Ulcers of the Mouth, yet this is not to be used too often, unless there be an Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy, least the Ulcers be closed up too soon, and so the Salivation have not a due time for its Continuance, which ordinarily, is at the least fifteen, sixteen or twenty days, or at the most thirty days, which happens very seldom, unless when it is thought necessary to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so long.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Speak not here of Chancres that are the Accidents of the Venereal Distemper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are cured by the same Remedy, that is proper for the Pox, but only of those that are the particular Pox, the Ferment of which has not been carried farther than the part which at first received it; and whereof we have spoken sufficiently in the preceding Chapters, with respect to the Theory; so that it is needless to repeat the same thing. As for the Practice, I differ somewhat from some Authors whom I have seen, not from a Spirit of Contradiction towards any Person, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I learned by Reason and Experience, that this sort of Chancres may be more succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and easily cured, otherwise than by the ordinary Methods.</p>
                     <p>They alledge that all Chancres of the right Sort, ought to be Cauterised, and then brought to Suppuration; and for this purpose, they make use of Red Precipitate, of <hi>Lapis Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> or the common Caustic, or Sublimate Corrosive, and they Cicatrize the Chancre with a Suppurative, after that they use the Ordinary Remedies, and in the mean time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:206364:50"/>they Purge the Patient frequently with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, for the depuration of his Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they suppose, that it would be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary for the Chancre to remain in a Part, for any long time, without transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting insensibly some Particles of the Venereal Ferment into the Mass of Blood, which may produce the Universal Pox, if it be neglected, and besides that, those who use the greatest Precaution, give Diaphoretics to the Patient, after those Remedies. All this is attended with an insupportable Pain, and unspeakable trouble to the Person, besides the unreasonable time which it requires. I am confident, that if <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Plaister, with a little <hi>Mercurius Praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus dulcis</hi> be applyed to the Patient, and if some Doses of the Solar Precipitate be given to him; The most inveterate Chancre shall be safely Cured without pain, without trouble, and in a little time.</p>
                     <p>If there be a <hi>Phymosis</hi> or a <hi>Paraphymosis</hi> (that is to say, the former, when the Glans is so enclosed within the Prepuce, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uncovered, or the latter, when it is so uncovered that it cannot be again covered) but the latter especially, being attended with an Inflammation and a Pain; the same Solar Precipitate, after once Bleeding, is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Remedy.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the Heat of Ʋrine and the Virulent</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea.</head>
                     <p>IT would require a Book by it self to treat of this kind of Pox exactly; yet all sorts of Persons meddle with it, and there are those who pretend that they can easily Cure it with Water and Sugar, others with a bare Royal Ptisan, which is to be taken every day, till the Cure be Compleated, a third Sort, with the Salt Polychrest or Chrystal Mineral; in a Word; every one does flatter himself with the Fancy that he has found an Excellent and easy Method for Curing this Disease.</p>
                     <p>Yet they who are most Conversant about those things, and who are to be Credited, are obliged to acknowledge, that if there are sometimes Heats of Urine that may be easily Cured, there is also a great number of others which are hard enough to be Cured; and that oftentimes the great Disease might be more easily Cured then any Venereal Heat of Urine whatsoever, especially, if it be not well lookt to at the beginning, and if the specific Remedies be neglected, or ill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.</p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:206364:51"/>
                     <p>I have seen no approved Treatise of this Subject, but what does give Rules that are to be observed, for a good Cure. And therefore, I shall not here particularly treat of them. Yet I hope, within some time, to give some singular Observations upon this Subject, which I would have willingly done in this Impression, if they had been ready for a publication.</p>
                     <p>Yet that this Treatise may not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defective, I shall here lay down a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Practice for ordinary occasions.</p>
                     <p>I do not repeat what I have said in the fourth Chapter, touching the Theory of this particular Pox: for although I did not very much enlarge upon it, you may there find that which is necessary for the Knowledge of it's Nature, and the manner of it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If the Person be of a very hot Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Plethoric, and the Pain, and heat of Urine considerable, there is no danger in Bleeding him, and repeating it as often as it shall be thought necessary; The Blood must be taken in the Arm, to make a true revulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in the Foot, which would draw the Humours more upon the part.</p>
                     <p>They were formerly, very scrupulous to let Blood, and especially, in the Arm, because they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:206364:52"/>believed, that that might attract the virulency into the mass of Blood, and thereby occasion the great Pox, but they were undeceived, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they saw that both reason and experience do manifestly justify Phlebotomy. The circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood does plainly shew, that if there were any danger in letting of Blood, the practice would be as dangerous in the Foot as in the Arm; and experience shews, that bleeding in the Arm does so much contribute to the Cure, that it is the means of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pox, because it cools and suppresses the inflammation, and thereby hinders the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Venereal Ferment, it disburdens the Sanguinary Vessels, and so makes way for Purgatives and Diuretics to operate with the greater Efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not alledge, that all sorts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ought to bleed, but only those who are hot, Sanguine and Plethoric.</p>
                     <p>I Advise withal that the Virulency be not neglected, and that the specific Remedy, which is <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> be not forgotten, which is sufficient for this Disease, if it be given with convenient Purgatives, as <hi>Cassia,</hi> fine <hi>Catholicon,</hi> or Confection of Hamech, and repeated from time to time, as necessity shall require.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:206364:52"/>
                     <p>Nevertheless this Remedy will be inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, or very slow on some occasions, as when the hot Urine is roapy, which happens when the Inflammation is very great, and the Patients suffer great Pains, that cause a Convulsion in the Nerves of the Yard, which by dilating themselves in their breadth, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire toward their Original, and so make the Yard crooked or twisted; In this Case it will be found, that one Dose of the Solar Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate seasonably given, will be a very safe and effectual Expedient.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, care is to be taken, that the Patient may be Cooled, which is one of the first things to be done, and 'tis to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that if he be heated from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by a Purgative, the Malady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thereby very Rebellious, and the Symptoms are exceedingly encreased; or the virulent Matter shall be thrown upon the Stones: Emulsions are the best means that can be used for cooling, after which, if it be thought convenient, there may be given some very cooling Prisan for Example, of whole Barley, the Roots of Water-lilly, Sorrel, Marsh Mallows, and of Liquorice, Linseed, the Cold Seeds, white Poppy Seed, and some Lemmon juyce, all boyled together in a proportionable quantity of Water, which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:206364:53"/>must be always a great deal, because the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient must drink as much of the Ptisan as his Stomach can bear.</p>
                     <p>When the accidents disappear, so that the virulency is mitigated by the means of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious Dulcis,</hi> that the running is not so great, and becomes prety white, if an Ulcer be thought to be in those Parts that are the Seat of the <hi>Gonnorrhea,</hi> there must be put in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san a little of the Salt Polychrest, or Crystal Mineral, or which is much better, the fixed Salt Armoniac, which is a gentle and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diuretic for cleansing Ulcers, after which, to consolidate the Part, there must be given, for some mornings, in a little Wine, twelve or fifteen drops of a mixture made by distillation, of two parts of the Balsam of Peru, one Part of the Ethereal Spirit of Turpentine. Or, this following preparation of Antimony may be used, which is a good remedy for drying an Ulcer; it stops the running of matter, gently and insensibly, and also expells the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the virulent matter, by sweat, when it has not been sufficiently taken off by preceeding Medecins.</p>
                     <p>Take equal Parts of good Antimony, and of Harts-horn calcined to a whitness, mix these two substances very well upon Marble, put the mixture in an open Earthen Vessel, set it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:206364:53"/>in a Wind Furnace, you shall calcine them, by stirring the matter continually with an Iron Spatula, till the smoak thereof be well over; after which the whole is to be put into a Crucible with a large bottom; calcine them therein over a great fire, for the space of two hours; you shall have a Powder, white as Snow, and which for some great and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar advantages, is preferable to the vulgar Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Antimony; which will be manifest by experience: The Dose is, half a Drachm with the Conserve of Roses, or any other conserve, or water of the like nature, as you please.</p>
                     <p>No injections are to be used, if they may be avoided, but sometimes we are at last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to use them, and that we may have one that is proper and safe, this is to be made use of.</p>
                     <p>Take a handful of Hors-tail, as much of red Roses, and five or six Flowers of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, or their peeling in proportion. Let all be boyled in three pints of Claret Wine of a good Body, to the diminution of the half, then strain it through a Linnen-cloath to free it from the grosser Parts, and make an injection with it three or four times a day.</p>
                     <p>All these Remedies will be unprofitable, if the Patient does not observe good Rules for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:206364:54"/>governing himself, he must be continent, use no violent exercise (especially what may prove troublesome to the Reins, such as much walking, riding) avoid drinking of Wine, Sauces, play, watching, and the like.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of a Bubo, or Poulain.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE manner how a Venereal Bubo or Poulain is produced has been spoken of in the fourth Chapter, we need only add here, that seeing the Poulain is produced in a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical manner, it is not to be imagined, that it is a perfect Crisis; and when such a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour does appear in the Groyn, which makes a Poulain, although the Venereal matter of that Poulain has been separated from the mass of Blood, and the Blood is entirely cleansed from it, yet there does always remain a great deal more, and even when the Poulain does suppurate very well, there is some time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, before the mass of Blood can be freed; and possibly this will never happen, unless there be great care taken, both to draw forth the matter by external Remedies, as by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Glasses, and Vesicatory Plaisters, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to give frequent and strong Purges by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:206364:54"/>Specifics; besides a Sudorific diet, which some prescribe, the better to consume the Venereal Ferment, with which the whole Blood is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>And upon this account, we ought to look upon this sort of Pox, not as particular, but Universal, because the virulency thereof does reside in the Blood, and it is upon this ground, that I am of opinion, that it does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same Remedy. I further affirm, that by that means, it shall not only be Cured with all imaginable assurance, but likewise in a much less time, then according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method.</p>
                     <p>To understand this well, we need only observe, that two or three Month's time is often times requisite for perfecting the Cure of a Poulain. When it begins to appear, they apply Cupping-Glasses to it, to draw the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter outwards, and stay it in that Part, which puts the Patient to a great deal of Pain; after which, they apply very attractive Plaisters or Cataplasms, and very frequently it is a Month before that Bubo come to a state of suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, especially in those who are of a cold and Melancholly temper; for in those that are Sanguin it does suppurate more easily: when the Purulent matter is of some maturity, they open the Bubo with a Launce or Cauter, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:206364:55"/>dress it as they do other tumours, till the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration be over, which is of a very long continuance: in the mean time they Purge the Patient frequently with Mercurial Pills they confine him to a Diet Drink and after all, there are some who make him sweat a little, or empty him by Diuretics.</p>
                     <p>If the Solar precipitate be used every third day, and Vigo's Plaister with Mercury, be applyed to the Bubo; Poulains shall be Cured without danger, if what we said in the Eight Chapter be observed, where we spoke of the Golden Precipitate.</p>
                     <p>By this method you will find that Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains are resolved, and the consequences are not to be feared, because, according to the Precautions that we have laid down, the Blood is so well depurated, that there remains no Venereal Ferment; and no Man can upon any good ground oppose this method, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, it may be often observed, that Poulains do disappear, (what ever may be pretended) after all kinds of suppuratives have been es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say'd, and the Patient has endured a long Fatigue. And therefore, there is a necessity, to use the same methods as in the great Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or, if it be not done in that time, those who differ from me, are constrained to use this way, when they see the ordinary signs of the Pox appear. Those who have practice
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:206364:55"/>about Poulains, know very well that what I say, is true, and if they would be at the Pains to reflect on their own method, if they would take a view of the sick whom they have not recovered, or have cruelly tortured, and if they were disposed to quit the prejudices with which they are Blinded, they would quickly embrace what I propose, seeing it is a more certain, gentle and short way.</p>
                     <p>But if a Poulain comes to suppurate of it self; it would, in this Case be very foolish, to drive the Venereal matter into the Body, to evacuate it by stool, or any other way than by the Part it self; which ought to be cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or launced, without expecting any thing but the Maturation of the abscess it self. The matter must be let alone, to run so long as it can of it self, by keeping in the passage a Tent of Lint only, and the like upon the Plaister which we have mentioned, and in the mean time, the other Remedies of which we have spoken are to be given, as if the Bubo had not been opened.</p>
                     <p>I declare, it is very much to be wished that Buboes did suppurate of themselves, and also, that if instead of the drawing Plaister, the matter could be so ordered that all the Venereal matter, with which the mass of Blood is infected, might be evacuated through the passage that is made after suppuration;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:206364:56"/>the sick would receive some comfort, under the extraordinary pain which they suffer, and the wearisom time that is taken for the Cure: But to suffer much, to be patient beyond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to take an extraordinary Number of troublesome Medicins, all this, I say, is sufficient to open the Eyes of those who are most stupid, and oblige them to consider what I propose to them.</p>
                     <p>I know very well, that it is a matter of some difficulty, for those who have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented with a contrary method, to accommodate themselves to this: reason, how Pregnant so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be in it self, has ordinarily no power over those who are not in a condition to use it themselves, or (if they be) are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by their interest, not to change; the continuance of the Disease, a great Number of Cataplasms, Pills, Ptisans maintain the Trade of not a few in the World, and are valuable enough to purchase some Lucre, which is fairly advanced by the Pains that the sick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, who being ignorant of the Nature of the Disease, do never think it great but when the pain is great, and when the Cure takes a long time: Nevertheless, because there are some able Men in all places, who hearken to reason, and who are so laudably disposed, that they suffer themselves to be convinced,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:206364:56"/>I hope, that there may be some one of such found, who will grant me one thing at least, which is to examin impartially what I offer; and when he shall find that what I affirm is not contrary to reason; it must also be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, if experience does agree with reason; by this means he will judge rightly, and if there be any cause for it, he may give me the lye, but I have no reason to be affraid of the charge, because, before I offered any thing to the World, I did three things, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd, I practised, and frequently reflected on my own experience.</p>

                  <p>WE have shewn in the Fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a Venereal Ferment, in its ordinary progress, does stick by the external part that first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it, and from thence does communicate it self to the Mass of Blood, by reason of a Fermentation which does multiply it, by changing the neighbouring parts into its own Nature, and when the Mass of Blood is infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, it is carried into all the Body by the Arteries; but because the Medicines that have been taken by a Person that has the Venereal Distemper do cleanse the Blood by an Effer; vescence, or because Nature does so provide, that in that case there shall be a continual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition; it does often times fall out, that a small quantity of that Venereal Ferment is, as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:206364:60"/>as it were, precipitated into some part of the Body, which shall be more disposed to receive it then other parts are, as we see in Rheums, and that Ferment loosing its motion in those parts grows fixed and dormant, having but little action elsewhere, because of its small quantity, whence it comes to pass, that it can remain concealed for the space of ten, nay, even thirty years without any sensible mark of its presence, till it shall happen that being excited by some particular Cause, or exalted by a foreign or natural Heat, it is put in a Condition of corrupting the adjacent parts, and these corrupting others, till at length the Mass of Blood be infected, and the Ferment is distributed through all the Body in that manner, where it does produce those Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that are as dreadful as they are surpris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Person who finds himself punished with the Venereal Distemper, without having given any occasion for it for so many years past.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BY the first <hi>Problem</hi> it was shewn, that one may have the Pox, and yet the Mass of Blood not be infected, because the Virulency is discharged upon some one or more parts of the Body, and in that case there may be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begotten and born that shall not have that Disease, because the Arteries do carry the Seminal matter to the Testicles; this Opinion is founded on Reason, and Experience does confirm it every day; for we see that there are very sound Children born of Parents sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Venereal Distemper; it is also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, that the Mass of Blood may be infected with the Venereal Ferment, but in such a manner as that the Seed may not be corrupted thereby; as when for Example, the Ferment is as yet very much fixed, or not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually mixed through all the Blood, for the seminal Substance which is the purest and most spirituous part of the Blood, may be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without drawing any Particle of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Ferment along with it.

                  </head>
                  <p>IF it be true, as Reason and Experience do shew, that the Venereal Ferment is produced by the Corruption of many Seeds, received into the Matrix of the same Woman, as we have explained it in the fifth Chapter, it is easie to comprehend, that if after a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has known many Men, another keeps Company with her, at such time as the first Seeds shall be fermented (yet without making any impression upon the Matrix of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and who by consequence has not the Pox, although she has the Cause near enough) that Man, I say, shall carry off with his Yard that Venereal Ferment, and shall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently free the Woman from the eminent Danger she was in, of having the Pox within a very little time,</p>

                     <hi>Problem</hi> IV. <hi>Why, amongst several Men, who lye with the same Woman that is infected with the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, one gets a Heat of Ʋrine, another a Chancre, another a Poulain, another the great Pox, and others get no Harm at all.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Problem</hi> would be soon explained, by alledging, that it depends upon the different Constitution of those Men; but to give a Physical Reason for it, it is to be shewn wherein that Disposition does consist. And therefore it must be observed, that when the Venereal Ferment that is contained in the Concavity of the Matrix is very volatile, and the Passage of the Yard is large enough, that Ferment being excited by Copulation, has the force to penetrate to the Prostate and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, to produce therein that Disposition which does cause a heat of Urine; sometimes it is yet more volatile, and goes into the Mass of Blood, where it does produce the great Pox; but if the Heat be great enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that Virulency by a critical way, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being carried to the Groin, a Poulain does grow there; but if the Venereal Ferment is less subtil, it stays on the outward parts of the Yard (especially in those who have taken no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:206364:62"/>care to wipe the same after the Venereal Act) and produces some Chancre, and those who take care to wipe themselves, who have their Yard not so porous and hot, who otherwise are very active in the Affair, or who come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Matrix is cleansed by those who went before, receive no hurt, although it does often fall out, the first gets free, and the latter is catch'd, which may then happen, not only for some one of those Reasons, which we have already given, but also because the Venereal Ferment which is in the passage of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is less penetrating, the Person being cold, or because it is imbibed in the Pores, and the small Glands of that Passage, in which it lyes, as it were dormant, whence it comes to pass, that the first came well off, not having put the Ferment into a sufficient Motion, for to make it penetrate, and that the latter does put it in an Agitation that will serve to transmit a share of it to himself. To conclude, many other Circumstances may concur upon the whole Matter, which may be easily found out by the Observations that we have already made.</p>

                     <hi>Problem</hi> V. <hi>Why a Woman, who has a Heat of Ʋrine, does not always give to him who has to do with her, the like; but (it may be) a Chancre, or a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and so the same, when she has a Chancre.</hi>

                  <p>THis <hi>Problem</hi> is very near wholly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the former, wherein it was made manifest that the quality of the Venereal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the manner of receiving it does make all that difference. Thus, when it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, and the Passage of the Yard is open, it does insinuate it self into the Prostatae, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastatae, to produce heat of Urine therein; if it stays upon the outward Parts, it causes some Chancre there, and so of the rest. This posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being laid down, it is easie to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that a Woman who has a Chancre in the Passage of her Matrix, shall nevertheless communicate heat of Urine to a Man who has knowledge of her, because the Motion and Heat shall so attenuate the Ferment of the Chancre, that it shall easily penetrate into the Passage of the Yard; and on the contrary, if she has a Heat of Urine, she may easily give a Chancre, because the Venereal Ferment of that hot Urine shall stay upon the External parts of the Yard.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BY a rational Consequence, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if one be more than ordinary hot, the natural parts very porous, and the Venereal Ferment exceeding active, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper may be got at the first <hi>Coitus.</hi> This may happen to a Man who has know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an infected Woman, when she has, or is very near having her Months, for then the Venereal Ferment, joyning it self to the menstrual Ferment, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all Women who are in a Condition of having their Months, does produce a more vigorous effect, which therefore becomes the more malignant, and when there are contrary Dispositions, and one does likewise take care to wipe and wash himself, and to make water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Venereal Act, such a Correspondence may be frequently maintained with one that has the Venereal Distemper, without any evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.

                  <p>LIbertines have been, for a long time, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for some preventing Medicine to Arm them against the Venereal Distemper, that they might continue their dissolute Life, and yet be without the reach of that Disease. We also see, that some Authors do give Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions for this purpose; from which some promise themselves marvellous Success, and are very confident, that by that means, Men may take their swing, keep as much Company, as they please with Persons infected with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper. By this, all Men of Sence may easily judge, that such Authors are Cheats, who to purchase Credit at the cost of others, do venture all at once, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute their Conscience, which must needs be struck with horror, for teaching a Remedy in favour of a debauched Conversation; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without all doubt, there is a vast number
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:206364:64"/>of Persons, who are Libertines by Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would go to the Stews, if they were assured that they should not catch the Pox, as there are a great many young Women who would not value their Virginity, if they were secured against a Big-belly. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, those who shew such Expedients, shall be the Authors of such dammage as they can never repair: But further, all such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives, to speak properly, are nothing else but Impostures, which yet have gained Credit with some silly Persons, who suffer themselves to be imposed upon, by the exceeding woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reasons, that they alledge, for Conciliating Authority, to that pretended Preservative; the most conclusive of which is such, as at most, does only prove the possibility of such a Remedy.</p>
                  <p>There is no Poyson, but what has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Antidote, nor a Disease without it's own Specific, and all the difficulty is to know these Antidotes and these Specifics. We have heard of Men who being fortified with good Antidotes did so vigorously defend themselves against Poysons, that they suffered no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, and still we see some Persons who have natural Talismans, and carrying such about them, go amongst those who are infected with the Plague without any danger of being touched with it; we saw in the time of the last Pestilence, a Man who was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206364:64"/>called <hi>Vinceguerre,</hi> who carried a Vial full of a Composition, which possibly is not unknown to us, and with that he went amongst those who were sick of the Plague, with contiual safety both to himself and those who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, though he exposed himself every hour to that greatest Fatality; Why (say they) may there not be found a Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of as considerable a Vertue, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Venereal Distemper. I am clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the mind, that we may be hereby induced to believe, such a Preservative to be possible. But if it be considered, that although God is pleased to send the Plague frequently amongst Men, for the Punishment of their Crimes, yet he does not execute his Anger upon them all equally, and therefore, besides his Grace which is the principal and soveraign Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, he is pleased very often, to make use of natural Means, which the Philosophers call Contraries; so the Plague has it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, without all doubt, which can extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it, as water quenches fire, seeing it is not in the power of Man to defend himself against manifold external Causes, which the Physicians call Non-natural, as for Example, from the Air, which frequently transmits the Plague and many other Epidemical Diseases; it is very reasonable for us to think that God has Created contrary things, that there may be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:206364:65"/>a possibility of our Cure, so long as he suffers the natural Causes to continue in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Course; But, as to the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, seeing it is commonly the reward of the Sin of Fornication, which God has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had in Abomination, as we have said in the first Chapter, and that that Distemper may be avoided by Continence, which is the true Preservative, it seems that it was no ways necessary that God should create a Specific Preservative against that: And for those, who being innocent, have contracted the Venereal Distemper, as Infants in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb, or on the Breasts, Virtuous Women who have got it from their dissolute Husbands, and those good Husbands that are trepann'd by their extravagant Wives; It is sufficient, that there are assured Medicines in Nature, and in the hands of skilful Artists for the Cure of that Distemper.</p>

Some others, that they may be more serious will relate on this Subject of Women's Months, sundry Passages of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:206364:66"/>and especially in the fifteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Leviticus:</hi> which is, to say the truth, a very impertinent Quotation, because they ought not to mix sacred things with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, when there is no occasion for it, and the Scripture is so mysterious, that we must refer the exposition thereof to those whose profession it is to handle it, who are of a more refined Character then that of a meer Naturalist. Therefore to resolve our Problem, it must be maintained, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Months never flow but by reason of a Fermentation, and the menstrual Blood at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting that Ferment which has been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the space of one Month, in the small passages of the Matrix, it cannot be, but that the Blood must needs ferment some other Bodies, which may be disposed for it, but above all, the menstrual Blood of some Women who have their Humours very sharp and corrupted, has much more force then that of other Women: It is by reason of this Acrimony, that we see Men have Heats, Blisters and small Ulcers on their Yard, after having known some Women otherwise very sound, in the time of their Months; but such inconveniences cannot possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the Pox, for as we said, in the fifth Chapter, that the Seed of one Man and one Woman can never degenerate into a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:206364:66"/>Venereal Ferment; because that would be against the Laws of Nature; It may be also said, that it would be no less against the same Laws, for Women's Months to give the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper; none could escape the Pox, and Women that are Big must infect the very Child in their Womb; the Women themselves must have it, and to conclude, a great many Absurdities would follow, which are obvious to the consideration of every one, so that it is needless to stay any longer upon this Problem.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is very pleasant to observe that some Authors do attribute the Original of the Venereal Distemper to the Stars. When some do alledge, that the Pox does proceed from the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the House of <hi>Libra;</hi> and others, from the Conjunction of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in the House of <hi>Libra,</hi> it would seem, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Stars went to the Bawdy House, and that there are some Intrigues that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206364:67"/>prove fatal in their Consequence, amongst them; I do not know why they have not also alledged, that they might get the Pox too, and communicate the same to Men, by their influences, seeing the one would follow from the other. I do not know, which is most ridiculous, for Authors to own, or me to go to refuse this Opinion; for, to be short, it requires but some grains of good Sence to conceive, that it is an extravagancy to believe, that the Stars, in any disposition whatsoever can produce the Venereal Distemper: They who are of the Opinion of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and sundry other New Authors, will quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to this, because those Influences, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, are nothing else but illusions and the imaginations of Astrologers, that we are only to reckon upon the Sun, whose Heat and Light is as much as all the Stars put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (which have nothing of themselves) and sublimary Bodies are capable of such an Influence: but Heat and Light cannot be the Cause of the Pox: And other true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, more knowing in this, then <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who, besides Heat and Light, did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all the Stars, Influences that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to produce powerful Motions in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Bodies, and also to change a Man's Temper, and by that means, stir up diverse Inclinations in them, nevertheless leaving the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:206364:67"/>will free, over which they have no direct or absolute Power, as the Angelic Doctor has very well explained it: those Philosophers, I say never reckoned the Venereal Distemper in the Number of Astral Diseases; but that we may not go too far, but seriously resolve our Problem; we must say, that it is very little to the purpose, to have recourse, in the explication of any Effect, to an occult Cause, when there is a manifest one at hand; seeing, if they will needs persist in the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Stars are capable of producing that Effect, they shall yet never be able to know, by what Vertue they do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they will be obliged to say, that it is an occult Quality, which is the same, as if they should say, it is, they do not know what; although, they will not, through ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vanity or Stupidity declare their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in plain <hi>English;</hi> and yet we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain (as we have done in the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the Cause of the Pox, as proceeding from the Corruption of Seeds in the Matrix of a Common Woman. Again, it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative, that the Cause of the Pox is a true Ferment; that a true Ferment must be of the Nature of the thing fermented; that all the parts of the Body being subject to the Venereal Ferment, the Ferment must have an affinity with them; that there is nothing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:206364:68"/>that has so great an Affinity as the Seed has to all the parts of the Body, seeing they are composed of it, that the Seed can easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a Venereal Ferment, after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men have ejected it into the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, which cannot happen without many Circumstances that can never be attributed to the Stars, in any disposition whatsoever. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if those pretended Conjunctions of the Stars could produce the Venereal Distemper, which they cannot do, we must wait for some Ages before it can happen, because, a vast interval of time is requisite, before such Conjunctions do happen; I will likewise add, that we might reasonably hope, that when those Stars should happen to be in a contrary Position, all those who have the Venereal Disease should of necessity be Cured, which is a fancy which can possess no Man who is not either in his Sleep, or out of his Wits.</p>

                  <p>IF it be considered, that there is during the Course of an Ague, an extraordinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fermentation in the Mass of Blood, and that, for a perfect and Healthful Crisis, it is necessary the natural heat do mitigate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and separate the impurities in the mass of Blood, from that which is pure, and that impure matter be at last expelled out of the Body by a rapid motion; it is easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that, if the mass of Blood be, at that time, infected with the Venereal Poyson, it must of necessity, follow the motion of the other impurities, and that consequently, the mass of Blood shall be freed from them; and this is consonant to experience: But if the cause of the Venereal Distemper does not lye in the mass of Blood, and that the Venereal Ferment is stopp'd, or fixed to one or more Parts of the Body, as in some Nodes, Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoses, or Ossicular Tumours, Caries of the Bones or the like, 'tis very Plain, that the only Motion and Fermentation which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:206364:69"/>does happen by the Crisis, in that Case, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly dissolve it, and that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the heat of the Fever, by dissipating the Fluid Parts, may harden the Nodes the more, and drive the putrefaction more into the Bones, by Augmenting the Acrimony of the Ferment which corrodes the Parts.</p>

                     <hi>Problem.</hi> XII. <hi>Why a Chancre on the Prepuce is more dangerous for giving the Ʋniversal Pox than one that is in the Gland.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALthough every Chancre, in what place soever it be, may communicate the Universal Pox, experience has confirmed this, that a Chancre on the foreskin, if it be never so little neglected, or ill ordered, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more infectious, for giving the Universal Pox, then a Chancre in the Gland; some have said, that the Prepuce being a double membrance, the Venereal Poyson does easily glide betwixt, and that from thence, the passage is free, for it is to be carried into the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:206364:70"/>Body; and this reason is not ill, if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that seeing the membrane is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible then the Flesh, because it is a Nerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that so it has more Spirits; these Spirits do volatilize the Venereal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and render it fit to Penetrate, and that this Penetration and Subtilization are Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Pain, and the continual Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that are produced by the Acrimony of the Venereal Ferment, whence a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction does ensue, that is natural to all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Parts, that shrink when any thing that is sharp or pungent does touch them; and if we observe, seeing this contraction is made towards it's Original, which is a Nerve, whatever is most liquid in the Part that does shrink, is press'd out, as it were, and push'd inwardly; which makes the Explication of this Problem: whereas all this is not to be found in the Gland that is a Fleshly Part, more soft and more moist, wherein the Spirits do not so much abound, the Pain is less, the Humidity does qualify the Ferment; and the suppuration of the Chancre, which happens more often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by reason the Blood in that Part, does continually draw to the out Parts, some Part of the Ferment which is in the Chancre, whence it comes to pass that it does not give the Pox so soon.</p>

                     <hi>Problem.</hi> XIII. <hi>To shew, if the Venereal Distemper was known to the Antients.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is highly probable that the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is as antient as we shewed it to be, in the First Chapter, that is, that it began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Noah,</hi> because it is certain that there were common Women from that time; and seeing there have been such, ever since, in all times; 'tis evident, that there has been also this Distemper in all succeeding Ages. Yet this is a thing which can only be proved by reason; for we have no undoubted Authority for it; seeing it ought to be taken, either from the Holy Scripture, or from Authors that treat of Physic, who might give a faithful Relation of this Disease; I say Authors who treat of Physic, for all other ought to be reckoned incompetent Judges of this matter, in which they know nothing; and if any one has medled with it, beyond his Line, he could only write by Hear-say, and some popular conjecture, which is commonly false, or at least Subject to suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>As for the Scripture, I do not think that there is any single place that speaks more clearly then that of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> which I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:206364:71"/>quoted in the First Chapter, which says, <hi>that he that cleaveth to Harlots will become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, Months and Worms shall have him to Heritage,</hi> which cannot be easily interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but of the Morphew and the Pox; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, because that Passage is not express, there does need some inferences to prove it from thence, as we have done in our Chapter, for though we read in many places in the Old Testament, in <hi>Liviticus,</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> that all those who lost their Seed were separated from other Men, this does not prove any thing that is like the Venereal Distemper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in all the same Places, we observe, that the same course was taken with Lepers, and Women who had their Monthly Courses, or some other of Blood, who were all, as well as Eunuchs and Bastards (though these were upon different reasons) deprived of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of entering into the Temple, as were also those who had touched the same Women and Lepers, or their Cloaths, all which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were declared unclean for some time, and could not come near to the Sanctuary of the Lord, till they were first purified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, which extended so far, as even to banish out of the Camp, not only those who were sick by reason of an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary emision of Seeds, Lepers and Women who had their Months, but also, those who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:206364:71"/>had nocturnal Pollutions in their Sleep, as we read in the 23 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> for the Law does declare; <hi>Castra Domini sunt sancta,</hi> and <hi>Dominus in medio corum,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Lord's Camp is holy, and the Lord is in the midst of it.</hi> And therefore, we cannot from thence form any Argument, to prove the Antiquity of the Venereal Distemper, and so much the rather, because an involuntary emision of Seed may happen sundry ways, without any Venereal indisposition, as all the World does know.</p>
                  <p>Besides those places we have quoted, it is also Written in the beginning of the 24th Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Husband, who took an unclean Wife, to put her away, but the word that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does use (which is this) <hi>propter aliquam faeditatem,</hi> i. e. <hi>for some uncleanness,</hi> is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to allow a liberty of drawing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from it, in favour of the Venereal Distemper, for <hi>saeditas</hi> does signifie Filth, Dirt, stinking Matter, Corruption, Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Ugliness, Spots, Pollution, Turpitude and the like; so as I do not in the least see, that this expression <hi>propter faeditatem,</hi> does rather signify, that he might put her away, upon the account of the Venereal Distemper, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for ugly, or pissing the Bed, or for a stinking Breath, or being deflowered, and the like.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:206364:72"/>
                  <p>There can therefore be no evident proof drawn from Scripture, much less are we to follow the example of a certain Doctor of Physic, who, to prove the Antiquity of the Venereal Distemper, did say, that in the 29th of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> there is mention made of a Disease, the Symptoms of which resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble those of the Pox, and to establish this upon a very solid ground, he did quote the 25th and the 29th Verse of the same 29th Chapter. Yet 'tis evident, that that place does no more speak of the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then it does of the Amphitheater of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and that in the whole Book of <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> there is nothing like it. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by this may judge of the rest.</p>
                  <p>If there be therefore any express Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it ought to be taken from Physical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and those of ancient times, and for that purpose, I known some quote <hi>Hippocrates, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Salicetus, Gourdon,</hi> who (as they pretend) had the knowledge of the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which yet is false as we must reckon to the first Two, and those who affirm it, are either Men of small Credit, or they have not read Authors.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that those Authors have spoken here and there, of many Symptoms that are common to the Venereal Distemper; but it is as true, that these Accidents are also found
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:206364:72"/>without that Disease, as the loss of Seed, the Falling off the Hair, Ulcers of the Mouth and the Privy Parts, Scabs, Blisters, Condylames, Warts, Tumors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We know that <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> have made mention of those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, sometimes of one and sometimes of another, but it cannot be found they ever attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted these Symptoms to the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they ever spake of any Venereal Ferment, or that they knew, that these Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents could proceed from that virulency, which is produced by the impure Conversation of Men with common Women, or by any other contract; and therefore it may be said, that the Venereal Distemper was not known to them.</p>
                  <p>There are some who believe that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> has described this Disease, with all its Symptoms in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Epidem. Sect.</hi> 3. of <hi>Marinel's</hi> Impression, where there are all the Symptoms of the Pox, as Blisters over the Body, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Abscesses and Putrefaction of the Bones, Pains, Falling off the Hair from the Head, Ulcers in the Head, Mouth and Privy parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this (say they) does signifie the Pox: And <hi>Valesius,</hi> the famous Commentator on <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> at his beginning of his Fourth Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary that he made upon the Epidemies, had reason to say upon the same Subject, that at the Reading of those Symptoms, there is no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:206364:73"/>Physitian but might be easily assured, that the Venereal Distemper is meant in that Place; Take <hi>Valesius</hi> his own Words, <hi>What Physitian can hear of one that has got filthy Ʋlcers in his Head, baldness of Head and Chin, without a Fever, Ʋlcers in his Privities and his Throat, and lastly, who has his Bones made bare of Flesh, and coming out</hi> by reason of Rottenness and Corruption; <hi>and not certainly affirm, that it is the Venereal Distemper; but there were many such in those days, by reason of which, and many other Symptoms, that</hi> Hippocrates <hi>mentions in this Work and elsewhere, I am perswaded, that there is nothing of late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in that Disease, but what was sufficiently known in former Ages.</hi> I do agree with <hi>Valesius,</hi> that as the Accidents he has observed, there is not a Physitian who would not judge them to have been the Pox; if there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in the case; I believe also, as well as he, that there were Persons who had the Venereal Distemper in former Ages, as there are those who have it now. But I affirm that the Disease which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> described, was not Venereal, but Pestilential according to the Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himself, and to make this manifest, 'tis only consulting the History of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and one will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction grant, when he has consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the other Accidents that accompanied those which are mentioned before, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206364:73"/>it was an Epidemical Pestilential Disease which raged at that time. It will also appear, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did never think that it was the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper; and I again affirm, that it was not known to him, at least his Writings which we have, do not acquaint us with any such thing. It might very well be, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the sick, whom he saw in those days, there were some who had the Pox, and that he knew it not, or that they had the Plague and the Pox both together, which might have deceived him, for (to draw to a close) although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was one of the greatest Physitians in the World, and that he has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished us with more Light, proportionably, than all those who came after him, he was a Man, and therefore lyable to Error; he lived in a time, when Speculative Physic was in its Birth, or rather, he himself was the Father of it; whence it it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, at the time of it's first production.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alledged, that <hi>Salicetus,</hi> who writ in the Year 1270. did give us some Marks that he understood the Venereal Distemper, which is true, not in these places that are quoted, nor in his discourse, but there is a Chapter in his Chyrurgery that bears this Title, Chap. 48. <hi>Concerning white Blisters, Sores and Corruptions which happens in the Yard, and about the Prepuce, that proceeds from Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206364:74"/>with an unclean Harlot, or some other cause.</hi> I have also found something to this purpose in <hi>Gordonius,</hi> who Printed his Book <hi>Anno</hi> 1305. after he had been for above twenty Years a Professor in the College of Physicians in <hi>Montpelier,</hi> amongst some passages that he has, that may be the most clear which is in his Fifth Chapter <hi>De Passionibus Virgae.</hi> That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the external Diseases that befall the Yard, we must reckon that which proceeds from carnal Copulation with a Woman, whose Matrix is unclean, virulent, full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the same Chapter he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes a Remedy for curing the Chancre of the Yard. And this is sufficient to make it appear, that the Venereal Distemper is very antient; and therefore we are to give no Credit to some Stories, that are framed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Introduction and Original of this Distemper, as that of some who have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it appeared first in <hi>Europe</hi> a hundred Years ago, or thereabouts, and that it was brought into <hi>France</hi> by the Souldiers who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the War of <hi>Naples,</hi> betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. and <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the Year 1493, or 94. Seeing we know that <hi>Salicetus</hi> and <hi>Gourden</hi> (the former of whom lived about Three hundred Years before) have taken notice of this Distemper, and that in all reason, we are to believe, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:206364:74"/>there was such a thing as the Venereal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as well as Common Women, although the the first Physitians did not well know it. It might possibly have been confounded with the Leprosie, of which we shall speak in the following Problem.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Question is not to be understood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Leprosy with which God, of Old, did punish Sinners, and of which, as we read in the Holy Scripture, there were three sorts, in proportion to the greatness of their Offences; If the Sin was small, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy was only fixed to the Walls of the House, if it was somewhat greater it was confined to their Cloaths, and if it was very hainous, the Bodies of the Criminals were more or less infected, according to their own demerit, or as it pleased God to afflict them; and this sort of Lepers was only cured by the Priests, to whom God gave the Power, in a Spiritual and Miraculous, as well as a mystical Manner, all Corporeal Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether useless in that case.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:206364:75"/>
                  <p>But yet we may find, that this Leprosy was known to the Antient Physitians, and that we have reason to believe it to be a Disease, as others are, produced by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of natural Causes, seeing it was cured by Medicaments, so long as it had not arrived at the highest Degree. But to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what this Leprosy was: it is to be observed, that altho' it was one and the same Disease, they did divide it into three Kinds, and they have given it such different Names, that Authors are at a great uncertainty about it. Some call that a Leprosy which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a Tetter or great Scab. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd that a Leprosy which the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> named <hi>Albarras,</hi> or <hi>Barras nigra</hi> and the the <hi>Latins, Scabis faeda,</hi> and on the contrary, the <hi>Arabians</hi> called that a Leprosy, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have called an <hi>Elephantiasis.</hi> And both the one and the other have made Divisions of it, and invented particular Names for it, which 'tis needless to recount. They who desire to have the Theory of the Leprosy ought rather to distinguish well, if they have a mind to understand any thing of it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, that we may, in a few words, say all that is necessary for the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Problem, the Leprosy is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that of the <hi>Arabians:</hi> That of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:206364:75"/>any thing else but a Disease of the Skin, such as the Scab, and others that are of Kin to it. This is justified by an authentic Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Venerable <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the most Antient of all the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, whom we esteem. It is in his Book, <hi>De Affectionibus,</hi> that he speaks thus, <hi>The Leprosie, the Itch, the Scab, Tetter, Morphew, and Falling off the Hair, proceed from Phlegm, and these are rather an Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and shamful Deformities than Diseases.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to insist on the truth of this passage, nor to mention what the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> have written concerning this Matter; I only say, that the Leprosie of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which is the highest Degree of the Scab, although <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> has named it as the first or lowest, is only an Indisposition of the Skin, for it may be observed, on this Subject, that the Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes filthy and deformed three several ways, either by very deep White or Black Spots, and that is the white or black Morphew, or by some other small Specks which make the Itch, which coming to maturity and a dryness, are separated from the Skin upon Scratching, in the likeness of Bran, which is therefore called Furfures; or they are reduced to Scabs or to Tetters, and at last to Scales, like to those of Fish, and it is upon this Mark that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have called it a Leprosie. But when the Matter of this Leprosie becomes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:206364:76"/>more sharp by the mixture of black, Choler the Skin is corroded thereby, and not only the Skin, but also the Flesh, Membranes, and the Bones, or rather the whole Body, which is affected with gross, malignant and dreadful Ulcers; and according to the proportion of the mixture of the Phlegm and the black Choler, there does appear a very great number of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Symptoms, as the falling off the Hair from the Head and Eyebrows (and the like of the Eye-slashes and Beard) a frightful or hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratical Countenance, the Mouth ulcerated, the Nose putrified, the whole Body filled with Blisters, Tumors, Nodes, Kernels (as we see in Swine that have the Murrain) the Loss of Judgment, and many other Accidents which 'tis needless to relate, among which Ulcers have been looked upon as Chancres, so that the <hi>Arabians</hi> have called this kind of Leprosie an universal Cancer, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> have nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Leprosie an <hi>Elephantiasis.</hi> It is this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly which has many Accidents common to the Pox, as the Leprosie of the <hi>Greeks</hi> has also some of the same sort, as may be judged by the Account that we have given; and there is all the probability in the World, that Men are frequently deceived with it, and that the Venereal Distemper has been taken for the Leprosie, and so much the rather, because the Leprosie is communicated by an amorous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:206364:76"/>Congress as well as the Pox, though in a manner somewhat different; and seeing there were many Leprous Persons of antient time, as there are a great many Persons who have the Venereal Distemper at this day, I believe that they might have been very easily mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that which confirmed their Error, was, that seeing the Antients did not know the Cure of the Venereal Distemper, their Sick perished, very near in the same manner as if they had had the Leprosie. And that which confirms this Opinion, is, that 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Antient Physitians did separately describe the Symptoms that are common to the Pox, without referring them to a Venereal Poyson, as we have said in the preceding Problem, which does fully assure us that there were those who were infected with the Pox at that time, as well as there are now; but tat they did undoubtedly confound the same with the Leprosie.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:206364:77"/>the Poyson has exhaled from such Stuff, or if the Substance that contained the Virulency be so dried, that there is no likelihood that one can catch the Pox by touching it; there is no matter of Difficulty or Danger in all this.</p>
                  <p>That which is doubtful, is to know if any Particles, which are called Venereal Miasms, do, by Transpiration or Expiration, go out of a Body infected with the Venereal Distemper, and if these Particles being transmitted through the Air, can, at some considerable distance, conveigh the Venereal Distemper to those who breath in the same Air. But seeing this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is big with Difficulties, it must be well distinguished, before there can be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution given of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis past all doubt, that all sorts of Bodies do transpire, and consequently those who are infected with this Disease do the same; but it does not from thence follow, that there is always an Evacuation of Venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Particles in that Transpiration, because the Cause of the Venereal Distemper does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lye in the Humors, as has been often times said in the foregoing part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and it is the Humors as well as the Sweat, that does furnish Matter for Transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And although the Humors be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Venereal Ferment, that Ferment may be so fixed, so tyed up and entangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:206364:78"/>other viscous Humors, that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por that goes out through the Substance of the Body, shall not be able to carry it off with it self.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the Vapours that come from the Mass of Blood, may, whilst they pass, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them some Particles of the Venereal Ferment, which had setled it self in some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid part; but that is so inconsiderable, that I do not think that the Pox is ever got by that means, and if it were so, that it could be so easily catch'd, there would need nothing else to give one the Pox, but a bare rubbing with the Hand upon a Node or a Gland of any Person that has the Venereal Disease, which is contrary to Experience. Transpiration alone does not communicate the Distemper, though the Blood be very much corrupted, unless the Skin be covered with inveterate Scabs or Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whereof the purulent Matter or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been received by the Party. I have known that some Persons covered over with Venereal Scabs, their Mouth and Privities full of Chancres, have lain with others that are sound, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing the space of one or two Months, without any Communication of the Evil, which proves that the Venereal Distemper is not so easily communicated by Transpiration, although the Parties lye in the same Bed. Yet this is not to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sted to, for seeing the Scab
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:206364:78"/>or Itch is catched by such Persons as handle the scabbed Party, or use the same Towel with him, the Venereal Disease may be also catched, and although there be some Persons who are conversant a long time with those who have the Itch, and it may likewise happen in the same manner, amongst those who have the Pox; yet they, whose Business it is to be concerned with them, ought not to handle them too much; for on the contrary, there are some who catch the Itch by only rubbing the Parties Hand, which proceeds from a great Aptitude they had, before that, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Scabby, as having had their Blood cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or because they abound in Salt and acid Humors; yet that which proves that the same thing does not happen, as to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Distemper, is the Example of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions who rub the Party affected all over, who dress their Buboes or other Abscesses without any Inconveniency ensuing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereby.</p>
                  <p>As to Expiration, we may say almost the same thing. If the Blood which is in the Lungs is not fermented with the Poyson, or if the Blood be very viscous, if the Mouth or other Conduits by which the Air does pass, that is breath'd by the infected Person, be not spoiled with malignant and stinking Chancres, the Air which entred in by Inspiration, shall
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:206364:79"/>go out by Expiration, without transmitting the Venereal Ferment: and though all that we have said should happen, it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that those Venereal Particles, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried any great way, or that they have force enough to conveigh the Venereal Distemper; for if that were so, the whole World would be put in a Venereal Fermentation, that is, there is not one alive that could escape the Pox, and any one that has the Disease, could not so much as enter into any Chamber or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place, but would communicate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper to all Persons that are present: It is very well known that Experience speaks the contrary; and the reason is, that there is no Venereal Ferment that is like that of the Plague, because this latter is more volatile, more active, and of an igneous Nature, and consequently swift and apt to be transmitted through the Air, whereas the Venereal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being acid, although it may be very much volatilized by a mixture of Spirits and Bile, is nevertheless almost continually entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in Phlegm, which is heavy and viscous, and can never, without putting off its Nature, be made so swift as to be carried through the Air, though to never so near a distance, and if it should be so carried, it would then loose all its force, by the Coldness of the Air, or by the mixture of other Particles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.</p>

                     <hi>Problem</hi> XVI. <hi>What is the true Subject of the Venereal Ferment, and if it be rather the Lymph than the Phlegm, or the other Humors.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis is the most celebrated Question at this day, on the present Subject. Many Authors of known worth are of Opinion, that the Venereal Ferment does rather invade the Lymph than the other Humors, that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer does receive it first, and afterwards trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the Blood. They alledge, that as two Homogeneous Bodies are easily united together, and that this Union does happen by reason of the Disposition of their Pores, which being alike, give occasion to the Ethereal Matter (which continually endeavours to make a Passage for it self, finding the Pores of two Bodies alike) to pass through the two, without any Obstacle, which is that which makes the Union of those two Bodies; the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Ferment being acid, must of necessity, upon the same reason, invade the Lymph ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other Humors, because it is acid, and consequently has Pores disposed in the same manner, for affording a Passage to the Ethereal Matter. After all, we see that the Lymph being made more acid by its Union
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:206364:80"/>the Venereal Ferment, does produce upon the Blood, the same Alterations very near, that the Juice of Limons or Vinegar, does upon boyling Milk, and that hereupon do depend all the Consequences and Accidents of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper, as Pains, Blisters, Tumors, Nodes, Tophes, or Exostoses, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Opinion is confirmed by an Observation, that the Venereal Poyson has a great power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Glands, which are always affected in this Disease, and the Glands being the principal Seat of the Lymph, we may reasonably believe that the Lymph does also receive the Venereal Poyson, and that the other parts do derive their Virulency from it. It may be added, that those who are a fluxing do void a clear Matter at the Mouth, which has a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the Lymph.</p>
                  <p>Although this Opinion has a great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that it already begins to be received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many learned Men, who have not as yet been at the pains to examine it to the bottom; I do nevertheless believe that it is false in its Principle, and that it is always ill understood.</p>
                  <p>I think that the prepossession, the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers were subject to, and by which they were swayed in their Judgment about the Lymph and the Glands, might much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their giving the Lymph more than was due: I am at least very much perswaded,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:206364:80"/>that there are others who have rendred this Matter by so much the more obscure, as they have a head-strong Zeal for the Lymphatic Vessels, beyond whatever the first Inventors had. They imagine already that the whole Body is but a Tissue of Lymphatic Vessels, and that all the Humors are Lymphs. The Blood, just after its Sanguification will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for nothing among them, but a red Lymph, the Chyle shall be a white Lymph, but opacous, the Bile a yellow Lymph, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So true it is, that when Men are prepossessed with the Conceit of a thing, they believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they see or touch to be that thing. <hi>Jupiter est quodcunque vident, quodcunque mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that the Lymph has oftentimes an Interest in the Venereal Distemper, as well as the rest of the Humors have; but that it should be the first, and the only Humor that receives the Venereal Ferment, 'tis easie to prove the contrary by their own Reasons, and shew that there is an Error in the Principles upon which their Opinion is founded: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they said, that the Lymph, in its natural State, is a very agreeable Acid, because the acid Spirits which enter into its Composition do make it to be so, and that consequently it would be very homogeneous with the Venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ferment, which is likewise acid;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:206364:81"/>without doubt, because they tasted the Lymph of some Person after he was hanged, which was made acid by Displeasure and the Pains of Death; for it is well known that there is nothing that does so much augment Acids as Grief; But those who have made a Discovery of the Lymph, and have observed it well, have assured us that it was insipid, and consequently free from any predominant Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and those who know the good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Animal Spirits, will never affirm, that in their natural State they ought to be acid; on the contrary, 'tis only the Spirits that do reduce Acids to a good Temper; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nitre, which is extreamly acid, is sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Spirit of Wine; this is very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, so that if the Remainder of the Animal Spirits, as they would have it, enter into the Composition of the Lymph, they would be so far from making it acid; I will undertake, though it had been so before (seeing 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Lymph does contain somewhat of an Acid, upon the Supposition that it owe its Original to the Arteries) that those Spirits shall entirely correct all that Acidity: And therefore we may easily judge, that what they propose, is an Error in its Principle, and this Error is so much the greater, as it admits of no Gloss, seeing there are Humors in the Mass of Blood, that are much more acid, as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:206364:81"/>Melancholly, and the Pancreatic Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and above all the rest the Phlegm, and consequently the Venereal Ferment shall have a greater Affinity with some one of these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, then with the Lymph; and therefore, according to their own Reasoning, it ought rather to joyn it self thereto; and so much the more, because that Conjunction may be promoted by the Motion of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which is raised in the Blood by the means of an Acid, whereas the Lymph does not ferment at all, besides, it is more liquid, and circulates more swiftly then the Blood, which renders it less apt to receive a Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is observed to be the ordinary Effect of the Venereal Ferment, as we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten said in several Chapters.</p>
                  <p>And what shall be said of those who take the Venereal Distemper by Chancres in the Mouth, in such a Case, it is the <hi>Saliva</hi> that is first affected; it is that which receives the Venereal Ferment and does communicate the same to the Blood; if it be said, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liva is a kind of Lymph; I say also, that the Lymph is a sort of a Saliva, and thus we shall confound the Terms.</p>
                  <p>I know, that there is a great Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the true Lymph, the Pancreatic Liquor, the Saliva, the Pituite, and the serum of the Blood, and that these Liquors do not differ so
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:206364:82"/>much in substance as they do in consistence, and by the Vessels that contain them; but nevertheless every one of them has it's own use; and they must be named so as that they may be understood. Therefore the Lymph must be said to be, that clear and transparent Liquor that is in the Lymphatic Vessels, the Pancreatic Liquor that which is in the Pancreas, the Saliva that which is in the Salivary Vessels, the Pituite, that which does result from the Saliva and the more vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous part of the Food, which after digestion does pass into the Mass of Blood as we have said elsewhere, especially in the ninth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>It is this that has a greater Affinity with the Venereal Ferment then any other Humour, because it may be said, that it does contain more of an Acid then any other, and that it is all over the Body: it is more Acid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contains the Acid of the Saliva which is the first matter thereof, it contains the Acid of the Food, to which the Saliva is joyn'd in the digestion, it contains the Acid of the Ferment of the Stomach through which it does pass, it contains the Acid of the Pancreatic Liquor, with which it is mixed in the <hi>Duodeum:</hi> and finally, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in a greater quantity in some places of the Body, it is nevertheless, in and over all Parts generally, because it does
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:206364:82"/>accompany the Blood, with which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mixed by <hi>Sylvius</hi> his Triumrirate.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, there is more reason to say, that the Venereal Ferment does rather joyn it self to the Phlegm then to any other Humour whatsoever. There are also some occasions, in which those of the contrary side, cannot say otherwise, seeing they admit that the Venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ferment may be communicated by respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it is certain, that in such a case, the Ferment that should be carried through the Air, would go directly into the Blood, to joyn with what is most acid therein.</p>
                  <p>And the matter which is known to issue from those who are in a Flux for the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Distemper, does deserve well to be called Pituite rather than Lymph, because it does effectually contain all the Properties of the former, especially a viscous quality which is essential thereto, and does very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the acid that is in it; it is also probable, that this quality, which sure is not occult, does serve as a Glue to fix the Venereal Ferment.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless I do not intend to critisise on Words, let the appellation be what they please, provided the thing be explained. I said, that there was so great an Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lymph, the Saliva, the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Liquor and the Phlegm, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, or the Vessels that contain them, do
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:206364:83"/>make the great difference that is between them.</p>
                  <p>All these humours do easily degenerate into Pituit, when they become viscous; It may be said, that the true Lymph is never capable of making obstructions, nor receiving any Coagulation in the Glands, or elsewhere, but when it becomes Phlegmatic, and although the Glands are the proper Filters of the Lymph, we know they have Arteries, Veins, and a Nerve as the Lymphatic Vessels; so that throughout the whole Body, where there is any Lymph, there is also Phlegm, and it may be ridgidly said on the contrary, that there is no Lymph in all places where there is Pituit.</p>
                  <p>I have said nothing of the Nervous Liquor, because it cannot be reasonably understood, when it is said to be a Liquor that is the Vehicle of the Animal Spirits, which they compare to the Spirit of Wine, and which is believed to joyn it self to the Lymph: And therefore 'tis needless to say any thing of it, seeing, to speak properly, it is nothing else but Spirits that are less subtile and more aqueous, and if any thing be understood by it, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny down right, that there is any such thing as a Nervous Liquor.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THose who have their Blood corrupted, who abound in ill Humors, and who have a great deal of Acrimony in their Blood, are very hard to be cured of Wounds, because a great quantity of sharp humors discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the wounded. Parts, Humidity and Acrimony are plain hindrances of the Cure, and these must be of necessity removed, if one would close up a Wound or Ulcer, and for that purpose, some success may be at last expected from bleeding, altering Medicines, that correct the Acrimony, gentle Purgations, Balsams, Oyntments and Plaisters; unless the Body be so Cacochymical, and the Humours so sharp, that a gangrene does ensue, which cannot be corrected, when it is confirmed, but only by an Amputation of the gangren'd part, but when the Venereal Distemper is found with the Wounds, the Blood is very sharp and much corrupted, by the means of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Ferment, which, seeing it cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ordinary Remedies, hinders the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:206364:84"/>Cure, and the Patient, is not in a Condition, so long as he has his Wounds, to take those Medicines that are proper for curing him of the Venereal Distemper, which is obvious to the consideration of every one, and from thence it is, that he is not cured at all, and although the Wound be very small, some ill Accidents do happen nevertheless, by reason of the sharp and virulent Humours that throw themselves upon the Part. This does sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the Cause of the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is in the Blood, or in the solid Part that is wounded; for it might possibly have been some where else; in which case the Wounds ought to be look'd upon as single and without complication.</p>

I might, 'tis true, have taken up more Paper, and spent more time, by giving Examples and general Maxims, by stuffing it with a great Number of Pompous and Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Receipts, by embellishing every Chapter with a premeditated Discourse
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:206364:85"/>by way of Preface, by quoting the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of five or six Authors, or doing as many others have done, who having nothing of their own, to say, by plundering Authors, do very much imitate those Jack-Puddings, who never appear on the Stage, but with Garbs composed of shreds of divers Colours.

But farther, if it was the Disease of the Country, why should it be catched rather by Conversation than otherwise? For Diseases that are peculiar to a Climate, are common Evils that are not confined to Persons who have Carnal Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with those that have the Distemper, but do also reach those who live very Honest and Chaste, and do not haunt the peppered Tribe, and these Innocents of necessity would incur the same Fate, seeing they breath in the same Air with the rest; but Experience does teach us the contrary.</p>

I am of Opinion that the said Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease is more Ancient then is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but it was unknown and cured under the name of some other Distemper, as may appear from the Fourth Book of <hi>Epidemical Diseases</hi> written by the Famous <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> what he says in his Book of inward Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and his Book of Ulcers. Page 171. Chap. IX. does confirm the same; as also in his <hi>Coacae Praenotiones.</hi> Page 535.10, 11. does prove that the Venereal Distemper was known by another Name, that they knew not that this Disease was the effect of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast conversation, and that they cured it oftentimes, under the notion of some other unclean Distemper. See also <hi>Plinius</hi> the Younger, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, of the <hi>Book</hi> XXI. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Book</hi> XXII. and in several other Places. Amongst other things he gives us an account of a Gentleman who was miserably pestered in his Privy-Parts; which being discovered by his Wife, she to avoid the mischief, threw her self out of a Window into the Sea, having first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her Husband to bear her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:206364:89"/>
                  <p n="5">V. The Disease called the <hi>Elephantiasis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Antients had a great resemblance of the Venereal Distemper; For they write of it, that it was an Universal Gangrene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Body, which happens to those who neglecting their own safety, put off their Cure till they be eaten with the Pox, and their Bodies be covered as with one U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Ulcer.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Nor do we find, that those Accidents and Diseases spoken of by the Antients (which for the most part agree with our Venereal Distemper) do befal those Persons who live honestly and chastly, unless they be infected by another, as a Vertuous Woman may get it of her Vitious Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THis Disease does consist,
<note place="margin">The Essects of an Acid.</note> for the most part, in an Acid; yet it is not enough barely to affirm this, seeing that all the Diseases of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours do consist, for the most part, in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid: But because the particles of the Acid do much differ from one another in figure and quantity, in Vinegar, for example, <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the juice of black Gooseberries, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice, and many other Acids, I affirm in the present case; that this does also much differ in figure, quantity, and motion, from other Acids: And this poysonous Acid does not in all appearance presently infect all the Humours of our Body, but it seems that one sort of Humours is more subject to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion thereof than another, and especially that Member which was first infected with this Poyson, as it appears in the cases of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal copulation, where the Privy-parts are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily first seised; or as it was in the case of a certain Nurse of <hi>Zealand,</hi> whose Nipples did first attract the Poyson; and as a little Leaven can ferment the whole mass, so a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:206364:90"/>of the venereal Ferment can poyson the whole mass of Bloud. The same may be said of the Foam of a mad Dog, a little whereof does poyson a Man to such a degree, that he becomes as mad as the Dog, and breaks out into the like Fury. It cannot be thought any thing but a Ferment, which passing into our Humours does corrupt them, and makes them of the same nature with it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But besides this, we may assign a cause for the venereal Virulency, which none that I know have ever thought of, <hi>viz.</hi> that we find in Men's Seed, and that moist matter that Women have in their <hi>Matrix,</hi> and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, little Animals, which, being venomous, do not only corrupt our Genitals, but also, after they have encreased to some bigness, make an universal and forcible inroad into our Bloud, perverting the <hi>Crasis,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the whole Mass.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Virulent Gonorrhea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Virulent.</note> or Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of putrid Seed, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when the Seed being mixed with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent matter does discharge it self at the Yard
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:206364:90"/>of the infected person; which running, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a stench, a pain, and with a white, grey, yellow or greenish, colour, and commonly with an inflammation of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statae,</hi> or the Neck of the Womb in Women, and frequently with an erection of the Yard in Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But in a <hi>Single Gonorrhea</hi> the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is white and watery,
<note place="margin">Single.</note> without any stench or pain, not occasioned by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste conversation, but by a too frequent reiteration of venereal Acts, even in sound persons, or by excessive evacuation, or the weakness of the person: To both of these there is frequently joyned Heat of Urine; not that the Urine is really of that quality, but because it does pass through a Yard that is excoriated inwardly, which cannot happen without a sense of great pain ensuing; yet sometimes the Urine may be really hot.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If a sound Man does lie with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Woman, that Member with which he first touched her Frivy-parts must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be first infected; for the humour that was in her passage, and afterwards in her <hi>Matrix,</hi> is composed of many penetrating, acid, and salt particles, which may sufficiently appear by the stench thereof; for particles of one sort make no stench, unless they be excited by others: It must therefore be a volatil
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:206364:91"/>and fermentative <hi>Acid,</hi> that works continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a volatil <hi>Alcali,</hi> and the former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the latter, a stench proceeds from this Corruption.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This matter consists of a salt Acid, that is to say, that the <hi>Alcali</hi> is composed of long and hard Tubes, in the concavities of which there is a great number of acid points; which being mixed with some ramous and oily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, do by a strange astringency inspissate the body, which was fluid before. In the mean time, the more fine salt particles are actuated by the subtile matter, and these compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a kind of fire, do divide and cut out their way, as if they were many thousand of Knives and Swords mixed together, and in action; and a Man's Yard approaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, does meet with this matter, which hews and cuts down all in its way; and from hence Ulcers and a Gangrene do happen in a Man's Yard.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.
<note place="margin">The Motion of the Poyson.</note> But seeing the ways by which this Liquor, or rather virulent Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, passes into the Prostatae, are as yet somewhat hid, we shall endeavour to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. I know no particular Vessels that serve for this purpose; but I affirm, that when the virulent matter does corrode the flesh, it hews out its way into the Bloud, and other humours of the Yard, stops their course, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:206364:91"/>inflames the Yard; and that this poyson, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, corrupting the Bloud, and the other humours, by little and little, must necessarily hurt the adjacent parts; as, first the Prostatae, and then the Cods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hence the Yard is violently erected; for seeing the Bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its grossness, cannot so quickly enter into the small ends of the Veins, as it does pass out of the Arteries into the Yard, it must be, that more does remain therein than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed back; and all the small receptacles of the Yard being filled therewith, they must needs render it rigid.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> is gradual, because the Prostatae are but gently pressed by the stay of the humours that are inspissated, and so the running is by drops, the Bloud and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, being separated from the Pores of the Glands, are pressed out by little and little; which pressure does not happen, but for the carrying the matter through certain Vessels, and discharging it into the Bloud; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible, by reason of the obstruction of the passages of the Glands, it is discharged by little and little into the Yard.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As for the Cure of the <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> we must first free the Body of the Patient from the virulent ferment; for without this his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is not to be expected: After that the Body being duly purged, the Ulcer must be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:206364:92"/>cured; after which the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> will quickly cease. As to the usefulness of Purgatives, it is to be known, that these do force a great quantity of the acid into the Belly, and from thence they pass by stool, as may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the stench of the excrementitious matter, which would not be so disagreeable to the smell, if the Acid and the <hi>Alcali</hi> did not work so strongly on one another. I am of the opinion that much purging is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, because it would weaken the Patient, and make him unable to endure the Sweating that is necessary.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The purging Medicines are for the most part prepared of some compositions of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, especially <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> or White Precipitate, and the like; but not always of such, especially if there be no fear of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pox, or if the evil is not inveterate. I shall set down some Medicines here, which are ordinarily used: As,</p>
                  <p>♃ The Extract of fresh Cassia one ounce, the Extract of Rhabarb one scruple, <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine one drachm; mix them, and make them into a <hi>Bolus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ <hi>Diagridium</hi> sixteen grains, Cream of Tartar, Antimony diaphoretick, of each six grains; M. for a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ The Extract of Rhabarb half a scruple, <hi>Diagridium</hi> nine grains, Oil of Cloves
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:206364:92"/>two drops; M. make Pills thereof, five in number.</p>
                  <p>If after this, many Mercurials be joyned to these Remedies, the Acid shall be so much the more broken; as by that which follows.</p>
                  <p>♃ The Extract of Rhabarb half a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> sixteen grains, Oil of <hi>Guiacum</hi> two drops; mix them, and make all into five Pills.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ The Catholick Extract one scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, white Mercury precipitate three grains, Oil of Turpentine three drops; mix them, and make them into five Pills.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ The Catholiok Extract fifteen grains, <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> twenty grains, Oil of Amber three drops; mix them, and make all into five Pills.</p>
                  <p>These and the like shall conquer the Acid, which is cause of the Malady, and force it to a particular part of the Body, which the Mercury does also perform by the means of its round particles.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. After this, those Remedies are to be used which do not only provoke Urine, but consequently procure Sweat, and withall open the obstructions of the <hi>Prostatae;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, all the matter is discharged; and afterwards such Medicines are administred as temper the Acid, or rather break its force.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:206364:93"/>
                  <p>The simple Medicaments that provoke U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, are, Privet root, Thea leaves, Savain leaves, Winter Cherries, the Balsam of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Balsam of <hi>Copayva,</hi> Myrrhe, <hi>Venice</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, <hi>Cantharides,</hi> Woodlice, <hi>Venice</hi> Soap, <hi>Sperma Caeti,</hi> Salt of Amber, Oil of Amber, Oil of Turpentine, Oil of Savain.</p>
                  <p>The Medicaments that temper the Acid, are, <hi>China</hi> root, <hi>Sarsaparilla</hi> root, <hi>Lign. Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> Sassafras, the Leaves of Thea, of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-green, of Savain, Saffron, the Balsam of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Balsam of <hi>Copayva,</hi> Camphore, Gum <hi>Elemni,</hi> Mastick, Turpentine, Bezoar, Crabs-eyes, <hi>Sperma Caeti,</hi> Corall, Bolus, Cuttle bone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place I shall give some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such Remedies as expell and temper the Acid.</p>
                  <p>♃ Crabs-eyes half an ounce, Camphore, <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine of each three drachms, the Balsam of <hi>Peru</hi> two scruples; mix them, and make up Pills, five out of one scruple.</p>
                  <p>The Dose is of five every day, which shall not only temper the Acid, but also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it by Urine.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Crabs-eyes one ounce, Savain leaves two drachms, <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine three drachms, Balsam of <hi>Copayva</hi> two scruples; M. for Pills; make five of one scruple. The Dose is as before.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:206364:93"/>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Crabs-eyes in Powder two ounces, <hi>Lapis Prunellae</hi> one ounce, the vitriolated Salt of Tartar, Camphore, of each two drachms, Balsam of <hi>Peru</hi> a sufficient quantity, Oyl of Savain half a scruple; make all into Pills; let the Pills be small: The dose is from a scruple to a drachm.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Mastick one ounce, Camphore two drachms, Salt of Amber one scruple, Oyl of Amber twenty drops; make all into Pills.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Privet Root two ounces, Oyl of Turpentine what is sufficient; set them some days in the Sun; this evacuates: The dose is from six to ten drops, but it is something too strong. Some make use of Spanish Flies.</p>
                  <p>♃ <hi>Cantharides</hi> one drachm, Spirit of Wine five ounces; which must lie for some days, after which two drachms thereof are to be taken with one drachm of Crabs-eyes,</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Crabs-eyes half an ounce, <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> one scruple, Oyl of Turpentine one drachm, Oyl of Savain half a scruple, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Wine six ounces; make a Tincture of them: It may be taken by spoonfulls. <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetane</hi>'s Water is likewise proper in this Case, and is a volatil oily salt composed of several, things. Lettice seed is of little use therein; but instead of it, it is better to put a drachm or two of Camphore: There may be also
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:206364:94"/>Turpentine given with the Yolk of an Egg.</p>
                  <p>♃ <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine two drachms, the Yolks of two or three Eggs, <hi>Quercetan</hi>'s Water a sufficient quantity; make up a drink to be taken at once.</p>
                  <p>To make this the more forcible to expell the acid, the Oyl of Amber and the Oyl of Savain may be mixed with it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We may also put some drops of the Oyl of Amber in the <hi>Alchohol,</hi> or most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rectified Spirit of Wine, and give it with a little Wine.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Then for tempering the Heat in the Corroding Pains, and in making of water; there is nothing better than Thea taken warm, for it dilutes the acid, and tempers the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, seeing the Particles that caused the inflammation, are dispersed and go downwards in as far as Thea-drinkers have frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to make water. A ptisan may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prepared of Barley, Raisins, and sweet Wood, with a little <hi>Salsaparilla,</hi> or the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent may very conveniently drink sweet Milk and warm Thea together.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Some injections may be also used with a strong decoction of Thea, which will cleanse and heal the Ulcers; and these are to be repeated often.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:206364:94"/>
                  <p>Or, ♃ White Vitriol, Camphore, of each one drachm, Spirit of Wine sixteen ounces; mix them for an injection;</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Common Water three ounces, Salt of Lead half a drachm, Camphore one scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; mix them for an injection. An injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Lime Water is very good.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If the Yard be very much inflamed, so that it becomes crooked, there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing applyed to it, that may make the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation evanish.</p>
                  <p>℞ <hi>Bole Armoniac</hi> two drachms, Camphore one scruple, Spirit of Wine a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; mix them for a Liniment: Apply this to the Yard round about, and the Inflammation will be gone.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Sudorisicks may be likewise used in a sufficient quantity, chiefly <hi>Guiacum,</hi> Sassafras, China, and <hi>Salsaparilla;</hi> especially when this distemper is something inveterate.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If it be necessary to close up the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, these following Pills may be given.</p>
                  <p>℞ <hi>Gum. Elemni,</hi> Mastich, of each two scruples, Japan Earth one scruple; mix them for Pills: Two of them may be taken every day, which will allways work it's effect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Ulcer be very great; if the Ulceration be so rooted as hardly to yield to this, you must mix a little Vitriol with the injections, which will eat the impure crust that remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:206364:95"/>Now seeing our Method does tend to this end, a good and regular conduct must be observed in Dyet, and the Patient is generally to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from all sorts of drink; unless it be a decoction of <hi>Salsaparilla,</hi> Thea, with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sweet Milk, or A ptisan, or the like; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will a little fresh Ale doe any hurt. His food must not have any thing that is sharp or fat in it. Toward the latter end of the Cure he may eat a few Almonds and Raisins.

This decoction lasts for three days, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day gives four or five stools. After this Purge, the following is to be taken:</p>
                     <p>♃ The Sugar of Lead, Camphore, of each half a Scruple, <hi>Sal Prunella</hi> one drachm, Prepared Steel one scruple, the Conserve of the Egyptian Thorn one drachm; mix them. The dose is a drachm twice a day: The
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:206364:96"/>following injection is also to be given twice a day for an absolute Cure:</p>
                     <p>♃ White French Wine two ounces, Prepared Tutty half a scruple; mix them. By this Method the Patient was cured in fifteen days time.</p>
                     <p>Note, that the Injection is the chief means for curing a <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> for I allways find that the most sovereign Medicines taken by the mouth, are not so effectual as those that are very near the parts; and there is no need to fear that the Syringe Pipe, entering the Yard, will put the Patient to pain, or other inconvenience, because I order the Pipe so, that it is completely round in the end that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the yard, and but a span long.</p>

                     <hi>SECT.</hi> IV. <hi>Of the Inflammation of the Yard,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Inflammation of the Yard is to be cured in this manner: Put the Yard fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into warm Coffee, and warm Thea, letting it lie for some time; or in new Milk mixed with a little Camphore; the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyntment is exceedingly usefull for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the said Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>♃ Bole Armoniac half an ounce, Camphore half a drachm, Spirit of Wine in a sufficient quantity; mix all together, and make an Unguent.</p>
                  <p>And the operation of this Unguent is this: First, I order the Bole, which is composed for the most part of an <hi>Alcali;</hi> secondly, the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore, which is nothing else but a volatil oleaginous Salt, with which I mix Spirit of Wine, which in some sort incorporating with the Camphore, is very active, by reason of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:206364:100"/>the subtilty of the air, and being put on the Yard, or an Inflammation, must penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the root of the cause by the means of its energetick quality, which in the first place does open many passages, and afterward the matter of the obstruction becomes more fluid, or at least more movable; so as one part of it does evaporate, and another is carried into the Bloud.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it happens that the obstruction that causes the Inflammation be so great that it cannot be entirely removed, the Pores and passages of the parts are corroded for so long a time, that they are cut and broken to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and so Ulcers are opened, which ought then to be purged, to carry off the purulent matter, for fear the Ulcers should proceed to lay waste the adjacent parts, and devour the Yard wholly; against which Fate good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are to be used, such as,</p>
                  <p>♃ Verdigrise, Sublimate, of each four grains, Camphore one scruple, Rich Wine three ounces; mix them, and make up a Clyster.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ <hi>Fallopius</hi>'s Mercurial Water, Spirit of Wine, of each two ounces, Frankincense, Aloes, Camphore, of each one drachm; mix all for the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>These Remedies are called Detersives, or Purgatives, the operation of which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:206364:100"/>There is Mercury one of the greatest enemies to an Acid; it is streighty united to saline particles, and therefore it is the more easily dissolved in Wine or Water, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for this or the other purpose. Besides, to these Medicines we add some Oyls of a volatil Salt, such as Camphore, and other Gums, which are mixed with Wine, and Brandy, that it may penetrate the Ulcer; it cleanses the part from the virulency, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the pores, so as the Acid is overcome by the means of the Mercury; to which there is also added Verdegrise, white Vitriol, and the like, which by reason of their gross and sharp parts, like hewers of wood, cut down the Copse, or Small-wood, and cleanse the Ulcers from all useless and decay'd matter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Precipitate Water that follows is not to be slighted; we shall give the Receipt for it here, seeing we shall have occasion to use it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>♃ Sublimate pulserized half an ounce, <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniack one ounce, Rain water two quarts; mix these together in a bottel, and shake them now and then, adding thereunto two ounces of the Salt of Tartar, the Sublimate will be precipitated; let it alone till it fall all to the bottom, and then put it into water; you may dry the precipitated Powder, and keep it till you have occasion; the Water is kept in a Bottel.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:206364:101"/>
                  <p n="4">4. This Water does then consist of some particles of Salt which were in the Sublimate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vitriol, and the Salt, to which some volatil particles of the <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> do joyn themselves, together with some others of the Salt of Tartar, which are fixed, so as the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil do put the fixed in motion; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid of the Ulcer is overcome by the Vitriol, the Salt of Tartar, and Armoniack; and these particles being in motion, do cut out their way round about the borders of the Ulcer, till the whole be cleansed by their detersive Energy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That which is precipitated is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Mercurial particles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains some others of the Salt of Tartar and Armoniack; for the Mercury, before that, was reduced to a compact body in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, by the acids of Salts which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but being dissolv'd in water, all these acid points left the Mercury, and fixed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the alcalious Salts, which leaving their place, the fine and volatil parts of the Salt Armoniack take place in the Mercury; for the one going out, the other must suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, seeing there is a circular motion always in the Body.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Quick-lime Water ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded here; for it is a known thing, that the Lime is an <hi>Alcali,</hi> which by the means of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:206364:101"/>Water does cleanse the Ulcers from the Acid, that was the great cause that the Ulcer ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and remained so; this Acid being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore removed, and the borders of the Ulcer hewed and lopp'd, the Ulceration is cleansed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nevertheless it will not be amiss to cleanse the Body with Mercurial Medicines, to sweat continually, and to take some Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine Pills, Crabs-eyes, and white Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; and the Patient ought to drink of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Decoction of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Salsapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla,</hi> but always warm, which will drive the Acid from the Body, and vanquish the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ferment on which the whole depends: The Ulcers being cleansed, it onely remains that we close up the passage.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As for the means that are requisite to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tund the Acid, we may give these following; first, there is <hi>Emplastrum griseum,</hi> composed of several ingredients which temper the Acid, as all <hi>Alkalies</hi> do, such as <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargyre, Ceruse, Tutty, that have all an <hi>Alcali,</hi> capable of breaking the points of the Acid, and to receive them into their pipes; which appears by Ceruse, a sort of Lead, in which many acid points are engaged, and being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken can no longer retain their pristine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and vigour. To these are also joyned some volatil Salts, mixed with an Aromatick Oil, as Turpentine, Frankincense, Mastich,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:206364:102"/>Myrrhe, Camphore, which put the Acid of the Ulceration in motion; and thus the Acid is buried in the <hi>Alcali.</hi> The like may be said of <hi>Diapompholix,</hi> and several other things, in which Mercurials are mixed, as Precipitate, which by its corrosiveness does restrain the too great growing of the flesh; otherwise, without it, this would encrease to such a bulk, that it would afterwards be hard to reduce it by Corrosives: Oils and pingous Unguents are oftentimes hinderances to a good and ready cure; to avoid which, 'tis better to use such as are composed of firm ingredients, but reduced; as,</p>
                  <p>♃ Ceruss half an ounce, Lithargyre, three drachms, Powder of Frankincense two drachms, Red Precipitate half a scruple, Spirit of Wine a sufficient quantity; mix all, and make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a soft Unquent.</p>
                  <p>When the Unguent is too dry, put al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways therein some Brandy to moisten it.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Prepared Tutty, Frankincense, of each two drachms, Camphore half a drachm, Spirit of Wine a sufficient quantity; mix them, and make up a soft Unquent.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Red Lead, Bole, of each two drachms, Mastich a drachm and a half, Rich Wine what sufficeth; M. make up a soft Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:206364:102"/>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Burnt Ivory, Lead grinded with Water, of each two drachms, Quick Lime Water what sufficeth; M. make up a soft Unguent.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It sometimes happens, that there grows venereal Warts or, the like, in Ulcerations, which may be remedied by Corrosives, such as red Precipitate, and burnt Alume, which must be put on the same in powder; the same thing may be done to hard and callous Ulcerations; in which case, some make use of a Plaister of Frogs, prepared with Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or this that follows:</p>
                  <p>♃ Ointment of Roses one ounce, Crude Mercury half an ounce; mix them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A Caruncle does accompany a Gonorrhea, and is a small fleshy Tumour, placed in the very passage of the Yard. The chief part of the cure does consist in taking away this Tumour, which is difficult to be done, seeing we cannot come near it, as in the case of an external part: The best way therefore is to make a small silver Pipe, very even, but something smaller in that end that enters into the Yard.</p>

                  <p>Or, ℞ Red Mercury half a scruple, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Savain one drachm; mix them into a Powder:</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Sulphur one drachm, Brass Rust half a scruple; for a Powder, as before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some Unguents are to be conveyed through that Pipe to the excrescence; such as <hi>Ʋnguentum Apostolorum,</hi> or this which follows:</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:206364:104"/>
                  <p>℞ Butter one ounce, Yellow Wax two drachms Turpentine three drachms Red Precipitate, Brass Rust, of each one scruple; mix them, and make up an Unguent; and this is used till the Carnosity be consumed. These Unguents and Powders may be made as strong or weak as one pleases, by adding thereto a greater or lesser quantity of Corrosives.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After the excrescence of flesh is corroded, the Orifice that was made by the Tumour, is to be healed by the following Powders, blown by the Pipe into the Yard.</p>
                  <p>℞ Crude Antimony one drachm, Bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack two drachms, Camphore one scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; mix them all into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> Frankincense, of each one drachm; make them into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Sweet Vitriol Earth, burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, of each one drachm, Yellow Resine one drachm; make them into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Sealed Earth, Ceruss, of each two parts, Camphore one part; make them into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Lithargyre of Gold, Mastich, of each equal parts; mix them into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ℞ Burnt Lead, Tutty, of each two parts, Camphore one part; make them into a Powder. We may likewise make Unguents of these Powders, with a little Oil, Wax, and Turpentine; and for the same purpose we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:206364:104"/>may use <hi>Emplastrum Griseum, Ʋnguentum Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, Diapompholigos, Opodeldoch, Felicis, Wurts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But whilst the excrescence is kept from encreasing, the Pipe is to be drawn out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to give passage to the Urine, and if it cannot be conveniently emitted, a Catheter is to be used to facilitate the passage; the Urine being voided, the pipe is to be put in again, and some of the last mentioned Powder is to be blown in by it, and repeated till the cure be compleated.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THis accident of the Venereal Hernia is nothing else but an enlargment of of the Testicular Vessels. As to it's Cure, we must endeavour to make the matter that causes the swelling to be fluid, by dissolving and operative Medicines; but if the mischief be come to a great heighth, we must draw the matter from it, to free the part from the Scher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tumours; and if after all, the remedies have not the desired success, it is necessary to make an Incision in the part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Patient may take Turpentine Pills, together with the Balsam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or that of <hi>Copayva,</hi> Crabs-eyes; and afterwards drink e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day a great quantity of the Decoction of Thea, or Coffee, to heat the body, and render all the humours fluid; and so he may put for his use some drops of the Volatil Salt of Harts-horn into Spanish Wine, to dissolve all the gross Liquors; which may also be performed by this which follows:</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Salt, Armoniack, Ivory, Bones, Bloud, Urine, a Volatil oily Salt, Harts-Horn, Flowres of Salt Armoniack, and the like,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:206364:105"/>seeing all volatil Salts are Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the venereal Symptoms. The Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Medicines are these that follow:</p>
                  <p>℞ Cows dung three ounces, <hi>Phellandrium</hi> leaves, Rue leaves, of each one handfull, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco one drachm: Boil them in water to a good consistency, adding thereto, Wheat, and Honey, of each two ounces; mix them for a Cataplasme; the Cataplasme must be applied very warm, and so must the following Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be used.</p>
                  <p>℞ Joppa Ale three ounces, Spirit of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feat two ounces, Sal Armoniack ten drops; mix them for a Fomentation.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:206364:106"/>Spirit of Wine rectified what is sufficient; peel and refine these very well, and leave them to digest some days in the Spirit of Wine, that the Gums may be the better dissolved, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards distill them by a slow fire: The Tincture of Assafetida is usefull upon the same occasion.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. SEeing this Distemper does consist in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Poison, it cannot be better cured than by such Medicines as expell the Acid out of the Body, or altogether vanquish and obtund it; and this may be done by purging, sweating, salivating, and using other altering Medicines.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Purgatives are not to be used too often, lest the Patient be reduced to great weakness of Body, and so be made unable to endure the fatigue of Sweating. It is best to observe a <hi>Medium,</hi> that is, to purge moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end. As for the Medicines, it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what sort we use, although many think <hi>Coloquintida</hi> to be the most proper Cathartick, not knowing the reason why, unless they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that it does contain more alkalious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that are fit to vanquish the Acid; to this they join Mercurials, the better to expell the Acide from the Body. It is to be observed that we must mix the Mercurials with Pills, or a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> for if they be mixed with drink, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and then be given, the Acid of the <hi>Saliva</hi> would mix therewith in the Mouth, and would very much impair the parts thereunto belonging. I shall here set down some Receits for learners.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:206364:108"/>
                  <p>℞ The Confection Hamech one drachm and an half, <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> 24 grains; mix them for a <hi>Bolus.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These are the principal Purgative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines prepared with Mercury; otherwise this sort is made up into Decoctions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Mercurials are also mixed with sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, which are given at night in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner:</p>
                  <p>℞ Treacle one drachm, <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> one scruple; mix them for a <hi>Bolus.</hi>

                  <p>Or, ♃ White Mercury Precipitate half a scruple, Resine of <hi>Guiacum</hi> one scruple; mix them, and make up six Pills.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But besides these Remedies that procure Sweat, the Patient is to be sweated every day once, by the means of Brandy, or <hi>Aquavitae;</hi> in the same, or the like manner, as follows:</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Patient being undressed, and stark naked, is set in an high Seat, his feet over a warm stove; then his body is to be covered
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:206364:109"/>all over with a large sheet from below reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his neck, so that nothing appear but his head; after which the sheet is to be put very close to his body, all over, that nothing be naked, and that the Air be utterly excluded: Then a pot of Brandy is to be taken, set under the seat, and kindled, but not all at once, but by degrees, and often, lest the flame rise too high, and damnify the Seat; when the Patient has sweated well, he is to put on a shirt very well aired, and warm; and he is to be put immediately into a Bed well warmed, and must drink a good Pottinger of Decoction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The drinks that we give in this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are as follow:</p>
                  <p>♃ <hi>Lignum Sanctum</hi> rased one ounce, the Bark of the same, Liquorice, of each half an ounce; boil them according to Art to 40 ounces; strain them, and give them.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ <hi>Salsaparilla</hi> Root, <hi>China</hi> Root, of each three ounces, Sassafrass Wood two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Liquorice one ounce; boil them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to eighty ounces, strain them.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. The Patients in the mean time, so long as they are under cure, are to drink no other decoctions but these; for they provoke sweat much, which is affected by heat, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that Brandy, hot Bricks, or other things of the like Nature, be used.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. After the Patient has sweated sufficiently, he must take a full Cup of such drink, that the motion of the Humours be not suddenly stopped.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Many think that there is a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be expected from crude Antimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they believe that it excites Sweat, which must proceed from it's Sulphur, which in this Case is like an <hi>Alkali.</hi> The Sulphur of Antimony being like common Sulphur, and this having no Acid in it, as it is believed, it must needs be that the Acid of our bodies (by cutting and continually dividing the Sulphur of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) does break it's own points, by which means all the strength of the Acid is vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and during this Combat in the Bloud, there is a motion, and consequently a heat; so that the finest Acides do flie out of the Territories of the Body.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. After having spoken of proper Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks, it will not be unfit to set down some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to the Practice of Artificial Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without which this Distemper cannot be cured oftentimes.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:206364:110"/>
                  <p n="11">11. The Internal Medicines for Salivation are as follow:</p>
                  <p>♃ <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> half an ounce, Treacle in a sufficient quantity; mix them, and make up Pills for ten times. A Dose thereof is to be taken Morning and Evening.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Camomel one ounce, White Sugar two ounces; mix them, and make up six Pills: Of which also a Dose is to be taken Morning and Evening.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Turbith Mineral ten grains, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle one drachm and a half; mix them, and make up a <hi>Bolus.</hi> The Dose is to be taken thrice a day.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ White Precipitate, Red Precipitate, of each three drachms, Old Treacle one ounce, Powder of Mace, Powder of Cloves, of each two drachms; mix them, and make up Pills. The Dose is from twelve to sixteen grains.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Sublimate Precipitate twelve grains, or sixteen grains, Old Treacle one drachm; mix them. To be taken once a day, till the Salivation begin.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The following Receit was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me as a great secret, to cure the Venereal Distemper without any danger:</p>
                  <p>♃ Mercury Sublimate one drachm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water twenty ounces; mix them.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning the Patient may take a spoonfull thereof; and this frequently cures
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:206364:110"/>upon seven times taking: But I think this too strong; so that there may be more water ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and a greater quantity taken thereof.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For cleansing the Mouth which is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated by the Acid, in the Salivation, it is convenient to take Remedies that are proper to rince the Mouth withall, and to draw the corrosive Acid from all the corners thereof, for which purpose the Pickle of Limons is usefull, being full of volatil and aromatick Particles; and if the mouth be rinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it does very much contribute to the cleansing of it, and much more than all the Almond Milk, decoctions of Figs, Roses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the Ulcers be obstinate, and the Pains insupportable, some Gargarisms are prepared, which are penetrating; such as,</p>
                  <p>♃ Limon Pickle, Spirit of Scurvy-grass, of each two Ounces, Spirit of Wine four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Opium</hi> four grains; mix them, and make a Gargarism.</p>
                  <p>When the Salivation is backward, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to take something to sweat; and if it be too forward, a gentle Purge must be given, that the Mercury may also operate in the Glands of the Region of the Belly.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. When Mercury is taken, the Patient may very well make use of such things as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Acid, and break its points; which may be effected by such Remedies as provoke
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:206364:111"/>Urine, and cleanse the Ulcers and the Belly.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In salivating, the Mouth is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rinced, that the Acid may be always expelled from thence, and those parts be not impaired; for this purpose fresh Water, new Milk, and Decoctions of Harts-horn may be used; for the Acid remaining a long time in the Mouth, must of necessity continually cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhode the same: and a decoction of <hi>Guiacum</hi> is likewise used for this end, seeing it keeps the Pores always open.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The Venereal Distemper is sometimes accompanied with Tophes, or stony or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Tumours, as in the Gout, which cannot be better discussed than by Mercurial Plaisters; as, the Plaister of Frogs, prepared with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Plaister with Mercury: There is also for the same purpose a Mercurial Water, made in the manner following.</p>
                  <p>♃ Tin five ounces, Crude Mercury three ounces; make an Amalgam thereof.</p>
                  <p>♃ Of this Amalgam, of Sublimate corrosive, of each eight ounces, distill them in a Retort in Sand, with a Recipient well luted; there will come forth a most clear Water always smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <p>Of this Water a drop or two is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every day, to put on the Tumour. I think that there is something singular in this Water that deserves to be noticed, and that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:206364:111"/>the Tin being mixed with the other two, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the minute particles of the Mercury, and separates them from one another; and the Sublimate, which is composed of an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eali,</hi> and of an Acid, being added, one part of the Acid works upon the Tin, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part goes out of the Retort by the action of the fire, and seems to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to us the figure of a Water, one part of which can never be vanquished by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Mercury being divided into very small parts, is in continual action and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence; and hence the incessant Smoak.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But these Remedies are only to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed when the Bones are not corrupted; for if they be, another method is to be followed; as when a <hi>Caries</hi> is to be cured, by grating, scraping, drawing out the small Bones, and cauterising them; upon which, there is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put a Powder that drinks up the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and effects the Cure by its alcalious and volatil particles. The Powders are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                  <p>♃ Mastich two drachms, Powder of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Orris half an ounce; mix them into a Powder.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Powder of Birthwort, <hi>Fab. vel Rot.</hi> Frankincense, of each three drachms, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore one drachm; mix them into a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:206364:112"/>
                  <p>But if there be scales that are but slowly separated, they may be removed by Remedies that drink up the Acid, and make them fall off the sooner.</p>
                  <p>♃ Spirit of Wine two ounces, the juice of the greater Celandine one ounce, <hi>Euphorbe</hi> one drachm; mix them.</p>
                  <p>Wash with this from time to time; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the foresaid Powder is to be sprinkled on the part.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. There are some marks of sores and Pox that are rubbed with the Mercurial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Fallopius,</hi> and <hi>Fernelius,</hi> and the like: And the following may be used for the same purpose:</p>
                  <p>♃ Quick Lime Water six ounces, Salt of <hi>Saturn</hi> one drachm, Brass Rust six grains; mix them.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Spirit of Wine two ounces, <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> half a drachm, Aloes one drachm, Orpiment six grains; mix them.</p>
                  <p>Or, ♃ Sublimate Precipitate Water four ounces, White Vitriol six grains, Myrrhe one drachm; mix them.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude the Work with a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some Cases: and first, I shall set down what I had in a Letter from Mr. <hi>J. Bapt. Pinket,</hi> a famous Chirurgion and Anatomist of <hi>Gant.</hi>

                     <hi>I must, Sir, communicate to you an Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, touching that which the Spaniards make use of for curing the Venereal Distemper on the Ninth Day; and there have been many of their Captains and Ensigns, who have been cured by this Method in that small time. I made tryall thereof some Months ago on a Woman, aged forty years, with good success: But I am very well assured, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be effected to purpose, but where the Disease is not inveterate: I also believe, that it is to be repeated, if the pains and other accidents do not leave the Patients at the end of Nine days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I thought fit to add the said manner of Cure.</hi>

                        <hi>A Cure of the Venereal Distemper in Nine Days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Air must be warm; but if it be Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Patient must not stir from his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but must have good fires there, that his Pores may be always open.</p>
                     <p>His Diet must be so regulated, that he must abstain from eating in the Morning; at Noon he must eat Veal, or Mutton, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, with no fat, to the quantity of four ounces; his Bread must be Bisket, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sugar: He is to take three ounces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For his desert he shall take a few Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Raisins; at Night he must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from all other food, but only one ounce
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:206364:113"/>of Bisket, with a few Almonds and Raisins; and for his Drink he must take this:</p>
                     <p>♃ <hi>Sarsaparilla</hi> three ounces, Sassafras an ounce and a half, Aniseed half an ounce, Raisins of the Sun four ounces, Common Water twelve pints. Make a Decoction of all, according to art. It must be boiled to the half. Of this Drink the Patient must take as much as he can; he must avoid all Wrath, Grief, and other Passions of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Patient's Diet: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Medicines; and first, this Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>♃ Four ounces of <hi>Salsaparilla,</hi> split, pill'd, and steep'd twenty four hours in four pots of Water; then boil it in a Copper, or Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pot, well stopt, over a small fire, till three thereof be consumed, and strain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part through a course strainer; put again this Decoction in a new Earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel upon the fire, and add thereunto a quarter of a Pint of Virgin's Honey, and an ounce of white Sugar; let them boil together, and scum it well; then take it off the fire, for such use as we shall presently shew. Then this Powder is requisite.</p>
                     <p>℞ <hi>Salsaparilla</hi> two ounces, <hi>Senna</hi> Leaves one ounce, Oak-fern Roots half an ounce, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modacts three ounces, White Sugar half an ounce; make all up into a powder. Make them
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:206364:113"/>severally very small, then mix them together; afterwards take them in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Morning four spoonfulls of the foresaid mixture, two drachms of the Powder, mix them together and take them; if it be too thick to be drunk, put into it some of the ordinary Decoction of <hi>Sarsa,</hi> to make it drinkable. If the Patient take of it, he must cover himself very well, that he may sweat, or get a stool; for this Remedy does produce both the one and the other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>This is to be continued for the space of nine days, unless the Patient become very feeble; for in that case one day must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted. After the use of it for five days, the Patient will find himself much better, and on the ninth day he will perceive himself to be perfectly cured.</p>

                     <p>A Woman, about fourty years of age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complained a long time of a pain in her Head, especially about her Forehead, and her Nose, whereof the cartilaginous Interstice was already corroded; for a Probe being put into her Nose, it was found to be all hollow, which was a sign of a great corruption in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:206364:114"/>the Bones of the Nose, and Palate; her <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula</hi> was also gone, with an Inflammation and Ulcers round about. We washed her Mouth one day with Sublmate, whereby the Ulcers were cured; afterwards we prepared one of the following Medicines:</p>

                     <p>By these she was gradually cured; in the mean time we made her continually sweat by the means of a Brandy stove; her diet was the same as we have already prescribed in the like cases, and her drink was nothing else but a Decoction of <hi>Salsaparilla</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> This Woman, who was in that extremity, was at last perfectly restored.</p>

                     <p>A certain Man, infected with the Pox, went to one for his Cure, who made him sweat, and besmeared him with a Mercurial Ointment, which excited a salivation, after
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:206364:114"/>he had been twice rubb'd with the Unguent; but he took a kind of Apoplexy in his Armes and Legs; besides, his Belly swelled; in his Throat he look'd like a Man strangled; and the salivation stopped on a sudden: They rubbed the parts with a little warm Spirit of Wine, and gave him Cordial Waters, but in vain; they gave him a Clyster, and made him take a little Treacle-Water, after which he gathered strength. The Salivation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one day, or two, at a slow rate: they applied a Mercurial Plaister to his Legs, and Arms; after which the Salivation went on strongly, but he was surprised with the same hurricane; the same Remedies were again u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but in vain, and he seemed likewise to be choak'd; there was a stronger Clyster gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and he recovered: The next day, after having salivated a little, he was surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a third time after the same manner, but more violently than before; whatever means were used, were in vain: At last, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he should take a Vomit, because, it might be, that in salivating he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great deal of corrupted humours in his Stomach; accordingly it was given, with a Tincture of the Glass of Antimony, of which he was sensible for some time, and began to vomit; and after having by this means dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:206364:115"/>a great quantity of slimy humours, he was restored: And the Salivation was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued for some days, after which he was completely freed from the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY Of the Venereal DISTEMPER.</head>
                  <p>THE Venereal Distemper was first brought into <hi>Europe</hi> out of the <hi>West-Indies An. Dom.</hi> 1493. for before that time, for any thing we can find, it was not so much as heard of in our part of the World; whence it is that the Disease is thought to be <hi>Epidemical</hi> in those parts of <hi>America,</hi> where we first had our Colonies: But I rather incline to think that it took it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from some Territory of the Blacks, near the Confines of <hi>Guinea;</hi> seeing I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not by a few of our Country-men, Persons of good Credit, who inhabit the <hi>Caribee</hi> Islands; that the Slaves that are newly brought from <hi>Guinea</hi> are infected with this distemper, even before they are set on shoar, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:206364:116"/>are also others who live on the Place, and that without any unclean Conversation preceding; so that oftentimes it does fatally seize a whole Family of them, and involves equally Men, Women, and Children in the <hi>Catastrophe:</hi> Nor does this Contagion, which frequently surprises those miserable Souls, differ in the least, for any thing I know, in respect of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, Pains, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from that we call the Venereal Distemper, the different Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates being considered, though the name is much different for they call it the <hi>Yaws:</hi> Nor does the Method of it's Cure, in use amongst them, differ much from ours; for both do hold Salivation by Mercury to be the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Remedy, notwithstanding what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged amongst us of the exceeding great virtue of <hi>Guiacum</hi> and <hi>Sarsaparilla,</hi> which they exert in their own soil, but is thought to be almost exhausted by reason of the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between them and us. It seems to me therefore probable, that the Spaniards, who brought this Disease first into <hi>Europe,</hi> were themselves infected by the Negroes, who were bought in <hi>Africk,</hi> to some of whose Countries it may be Epidemical; for there are sundry people on the confines of <hi>Guinea,</hi> who had that barbarous Custome of changing Men for Merchandise in their dealings with the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> However it be, this Contagious Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:206364:116"/>making gradual advances, has so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected these parts of the World, that if it now raged with the same swiftness with which at first it made it's assaults, the whole Race of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> must in a few Ages Perish by it's fury, or at least be so confined to Hospitals, that they would be rendred utterly uncapable of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging those Affairs that maintain Humane so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: But, like to a Plant removed from it's Natural to a Foreign Soil, the Disease does not so well agree with our European Climate, but languishes more and more, and goes off with less Pomp. When it first arrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, in seising a Person, it corrupted the whole Mass of his bloud, and did discover it self by extreme pains in the Head and Joints, and Ulcers in divers Parts. But an hundred years a go, it did first shew it self by a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> which it continues to this day, seeking to vent it self this way; with no other manifest Symptome, unless that in a very few, a small boil in the Privities (commonly called a Chancre) is the first mark of the Distemper; whose virulency not being ejected by the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea,</hi> does very quickly invade and infect the Mass of bloud.</p>
                  <p>This Venereal Distemper is propagated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Generation, whence a poor Infant from the infection of either of the Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the disease in it's first formation, or by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:206364:117"/>touching some soft part, so as the Virulency and Inflammation do insinuate themselves into the Body, upon these and the like occasions. First, in giving or receiving suck the Infant may either infect the Nurse by the wide Pores of her Breast, or the Nurse the Infant by it's Mouth. Secondly, Infants, if they lie naked in the same bed with infected Persons; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Persons grown up, whose flesh is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come firm with Age, can hardly be infected, but by an impure Conversation, though they lie with the diseased in the same bed, yet the flesh of Infants being more tender, and of a looser texture, receives the Poison easily, which I have more than once observed in Infants, who having lain with their infected Parents, catched the Distemper of them. But Thirdly, The Contact of a soft part happens most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in having to do with an unclean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and therefore the Venereal Distemper is propagated this way especially; seeing the Yard being turgid with the Spirits that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined to Generation, does quickly suffer by a Venereal Ulcer, or Blister lodging in the Neck of the Females Womb; either of which lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inwardly, the women may nevertheless seem to be sound, the Poison being either detained by the Urine, and other humours, passing through these parts, or being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes washed, and in some measure expelled
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:206364:117"/>by the menstrual Purgations. This Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my opinion does first seise the carnous substance of the Yard, which it corrupts, and it does first communicate thereunto an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and soon after an Ulcerous disposition by degrees; and hence it is that the purulent matter, such as we perceive in a <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> does pass into the Ureter by drops; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this for this Reason: For I my self have seen this virulent Matter come out of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruos substance of the Gland, and not pass by the Ureter; there being no Ulcer that affected either the Gland, or the Prepuce: But at last taking deeper root, it uses to lay waste the Glands, Prostate, with a virulent Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; which is frequently seen in the bodies of those who die of this distemper.</p>
                  <p>This Disease does make it's progress by the following steps, (sooner or later, as the Female that gave it was more or less infected, and also according to the temper that is more or less disposed to receive the Corruption.) First, the privy Parts are tormented with an unusual pain, accompanied as it were with a rotation of the Testicles; then, if the party have not his Prepuce turned back from his Gland, there is a spot very like one of the Small-pox at it's first breaking out, both in respect of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and bigness: Presently after this spot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a liquour drops out like to seed, which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:206364:118"/>daily grows more and more unlike seed, both in respect of colour and consistency, till it grow somewhat more yellow than the yolk of an Egg; and in a more virulent Pox, it is not only green, but it is likewise mixed with a waterish Humour tinged deeply with bloud. The said Blister becomes at length an Ulcer (at first not unlike the <hi>Apthae</hi> that are in the mouths of Infants) and daily spreads and penetrates, over and into the part; a hard <hi>Callus</hi> growing upon the Orifice. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is to be observed, that the foresaid Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is seldom accompanied with a <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> in those who either have had a <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or have their Prepuce turned back from their Gland, seeing their Gland growing hard, by reason of the Air to which it is exposed, and the frequent pressure it sustains by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen it always touches, is not so soon dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Persons of this sort are seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled with an Ulcer in their Gland, 'tis only a <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> that happens in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forementioned.</p>
                  <p>THis is followed by other Symptomes; as, first, a great sense of pain in the Yard, when it is erected, as if it were violently grasped with a strong hand; which happens most in the night time, when the Patient grows warm in his Bed; which painfull constriction of the Yard, I hold to be the most <hi>Pathognomical</hi> sign
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:206364:118"/>of the Disease in this state; the Yard is also made crooked by a violent contraction, which when it is erected, as it uses to be, brings an intolerable pain: There is also heat of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, which for the most part is not perceived in the time of making water, but when the Patient has just done, he is extreamly burnt through all the passage of his Yard, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Gland. For sometimes the <hi>Ʋre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi> being corroded and excoriated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual running of sharp and purulent Matter, Nature somewhat too precipitant in supplying what is lost, does form a loose and spongeous flesh, which daily encreasing, and growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly into a confirmed hardness, so fills the urinary passage with carnous excrescences, that the Patient cannot any more make water, and these Caruncles do send forth some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Matter out of the Ulcers that grow by them, which both perplexes the Physician in the Cure, and is of a more tremendous aspect than death it self to the Patient. And it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, that the purulent Matter, which should have been discharged by a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea,</hi> is thrown upon the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a virulent motion, or the use of Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, which occasions an horrible sense of pain, and produces an Inflammation of the part; sometimes one, and sometimes both sides of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> swelling prodigiously, by
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:206364:119"/>reason of this; in the mean time the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> is but slow, yet the heat of Urine is not the more abated. And these are the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Symptomes of this Disease, its state con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thus.</p>
                  <p>But when, by reason of the length of the Disease, and its continuance in the said parts, the Contagion is carried upwards, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually infects the Mass of Bloud; or when the humours are corrupted by the virulent matter retained in the Body, through the use of Astringents, a <hi>real Pox</hi> is produced; in which, Tumours or <hi>Bubo's</hi> appearing oftentimes in the Groin, do constitute the first degree thereof. After this, pains torment the Head, and spaces betwixt the Joints, <hi>viz.</hi> the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Armes, and Legs, without any order, though with some intermission in the day time; for in the night, the Patient, being warm, is very seldom free from them; nor do they easily vanish till toward the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Tetters and dry Scabs do deform sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of the Body: These are of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish colour, not unlike a Honey-comb, whereby they may be known from all others: Sometimes they spread over several parts of the Body, with a larger surface, in the same manner as the Leprosie is represented in the Books of the ancient Writers. But the more that this scab is diffused over the Body, the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:206364:119"/>Patient is the less tortured with pain. All the Symptomes do gradually encrease to an extreme violence, but especially the pain of the Head, which at length becomes to be so intolerable, that the miserable creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any longer confine himself to his Bed, but is forced to jump out upon the Floor, and run about like a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> till day light. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it happens by the vehemency of the pain, that the Skull, and the Bones of the Legs and Armes are raised, in sundry places, into hard tumours, called <hi>Exostoses,</hi> not unlike the bony excrescences in the Legs of Horses, commonly called a <hi>Spavin:</hi> And the Bones being so beset with Tumours, contract a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and they putrifie by reason of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Pain and Inflammation. Likewise <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedenick Ʋlcers</hi> destroy sundry places of the Body, which first invading the Jaws, pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly by the Palate into the Cartilage of the Nose, which they quickly devour; so that the Nose, wanting its prop, must fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. The Ulcers daily increasing, and the Pain augmented, the Patient being partly overcome with incessant torture, and partly eaten up with Ulcers and Petrefaction, does live a deplorable life, surcharged with torment, stench, rottenness, and reproach, till at length Death seising each member by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, his torn and mutilated Carcase being so
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:206364:120"/>much noisome to the living, is committed to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The extrinsick, or (as they say) the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Nature of this Distemper, is no more known to me than is the essence of a Plant, or of an Animal, unless in so far as the thing may appear from the Symptomes we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready described: Whatever may be said of it, I am sure, that the Humour that does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, partakes very much of an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whence proceed so many evils; 'tis also plain, that the said Humour ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated, and by such means as are approved by Experience, the Mistress of Physicians; seeing there has not been as yet found any immediate specifick, by which the Venereal Distemper may be vanquished, without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evacuation. Neither are we to think, that Mercury, or the drying Woods, as they call them, are to have the Title of Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, till it be proved by plain examples, that either Mercury has completely cured the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distemper without Salivation; or that a Decoction of the Woods has performed the same without sweating. And as I have learn'd by Experience, that common Sudorificks have been of as great use in this Distemper, as the Decoction of the Woods; so I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but if there were any thing in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or Animal Kingdom, found equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:206364:120"/>to Mercury in virtue, for exciting Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it would be also equivalent to it for curing the Venereal Distemper; but as this disease, when confin'd to the limits of a <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> does very much differ from the same when it has corrupted the whole Mass of Bloud, and gets the name of the Venereal distemper in a strict sense; so the Evacuation by which the matter of the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is different from that whereby the Pox already formed, is rooted out.</p>

                     <head>The Cure of the Virulent <hi>Gonorrhea.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS to the <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> of which we shall treat first, the whole stress of Cure (for any thing we have yet found) does lie on <hi>Cathartick,</hi> or purgative Medicines; by the means of which either the peccant humour is expelled out of the Body, or the natural Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Body are diverted, which otherwise would afford sustinence to the enemy. But although both Reason and Experience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade me, that this distemper may be cured by any <hi>Cathartick</hi> given often, and for a long me together; yet those Purgatives seem to me to carry a more vigorous Energy, which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:206364:121"/>strongly purge out and expell the Bile, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the noxious serosities out from the Bloud: And therefore, I have sometimes admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred help to the poor by the bare root of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapp;</hi> for as this served the turn, so I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their inability to purchase dearer Medicines: But when the disease draws a conspicuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation along with it, and the purging Medicaments by which it is to be vanquished are also hot, a cooling diet must be prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the first to the last of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>I use to make my Prescription thus: Take the greater Pill coched three drachms, of Extract Rudy one drachm, of Resin of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap,</hi> of <hi>Diagraphium,</hi> of each a drachm; with a sufficient quantity of Balm of <hi>Gilead;</hi> make up Pills, six out of every drachm: Four of these are to be taken every morning at four or five of the Clock (so that the Patient may sleep upon them) for twelve, fourteen, or more days, till the heat of Urine, and the Yellow colour of the Seed-like Matter be very much diminished; and when this is effected, I think it will be sufficient if the Patient take the same every other day, for the space of two weeks more; which time being past, it will be enough to take the Pills twice a week, till the humour that used to drop out of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do quite vanish, which for the most part happens not till after many days. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:206364:121"/>it be commonly said, that such a Matter that is perceived to come out by drops (after the heat of the Urine, and Yellow colour of the running, is over in the Morning, especially when the top of the Yard is pressed with the fingers) does only proceed from a weakness, and laxness of the Parts, by reason of the long stay of the virulent ferment there; yet poor Creatures find to their sorrow, that this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Contagion, that is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expelled out of the Body; which although it be in some measure subdued, does on every light occasion (as too much drinking, too great exercise, or the like) afford new Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal evidences of the real existence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, whilst the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> re-usurps it's anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Province, if the Patient avoid the fatigue of purging, when the distemper, not being throughly rooted out, does absolutely require it.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> does not yield to this sort of Purgatives, it will be convenient, instead of the Pills, especially in those who are purged with some difficulty, to give betwixt whiles some more powerfull Medicament; such as the following Potion, which at once taking, has sometimes contributed more to the stopping of a <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> than a more gentle Cathartick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated:</p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:206364:122"/>
                     <p>℞ Tamarinds half an ounce, Senna leaves two drachms, Rhubarb one drachm and an half; boil them in a sufficient quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there may be three ounces; when strained dissolve therein Manna, Syrup of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of each one ounce, Syrup of Harts-horn, and Electuary of the Juice of Roses, of each two drachms; mix them, and make up a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
                     <p>Or, If the Cure proceed too slowly, give Turbith Mineral eight grains, only for two or three times, (and that with the intermission of some space of time, lest it cause a Salivation,) which remedy is to be preferred to all others, especially for the curing of a more inveterate <hi>Gonorrhea;</hi> or the following Pills may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven twice a week:</p>
                     <p>♃ <hi>Pill. ex duob.</hi> half a drachm, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius dulcis</hi> one scruple, Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity; make up four to be taken very early in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>But sometimes it happens, that the Patient, upon the repeated use of the aforesaid Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, comes to bear such a strong aversion to them, that he cannot endure either the sight or the taste of the Medicines; and sometimes the Body from a certain peculiarity of constitution does pertinacioiusly oppose the operation and force of Purgatives,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> so that a sufficient quantity of the peccant humour
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:206364:122"/>cannot be evacuated; and thus when there is too great diligence used to no purpose, the Pox takes place at length, invading especially such persons whose bodies do most resist Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick Medicines: When the Case is such, Clysters are to be used; which being injected, the event will answer to both indications, <hi>viz.</hi> for purging the humour, and conveying it from the part affected: And this is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious than the former Method, but not so safe in my opinion, seeing the former, though more troublesome by it's continuance, yet has less of danger; beeause by it's means no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the virulent Ferment does remain in the bowels ready to raise new tumults: But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency is very easily avoided if proper Purgatives be likewise given on such days as the Clysters are not taken. I proceed therefore after this Method; I take care that the foresaid Pills, or others of the like Nature, be given for two or three Mornings following; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I order a Clyster to be given in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at five a Clock in the Afternoon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day till the Symptomes shall quite disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; only once or twice in the week I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a Purgative, omitting the Clyster for that day.</p>
                     <p>℞ An Electuary of the Juice of Roses six drachms, <hi>Venice Turpentine</hi> dissolved in the Yolk of an Egg half an ounce; dissolve them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:206364:123"/>in Barley water one pint; strain all, and put thereto <hi>Diacatholicon</hi> Electuary two ounces; mix them, and make up a Clyster.</p>
                     <p>Every night I also allow twenty five drops of Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> or the Balm of <hi>Mecha,</hi> when the Patient is going to bed, which Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing it is a liquid and pure sort of Turpentine, has likewise the same virtue, and affords a sovereign relief against the Ulcerous Disposition of the Privy parts; therefore in case it cannot be had, <hi>Cyprian</hi> Turpentine may in it's stead be given at the times forementioned, the bigness of a Walnut in quantity.</p>
                     <p>Whilst the Cure goes on, in what method soever it be manag'd, I forbid the Patient all meats that are Salt, or of no good Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; such as Beef, Pork, Fish, Cheese, Roots, Oils, and all Summer Fruit, instead of which I allow Mutton, Veal, Chickens, Rabbets, and others that are of an easie digestion: And I advise that the Patient may also be moderate in using these, that he take them only so, as his strength may not fail. As for his drink, he must abdicate Wine in general, as also all Spirituous and Acid drink; and keep himself to Milk and Water, <hi>viz.</hi> three parts of boil'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a fourth of Milk; only at dinner and supper a little small Ale may be allowed him. Moreover to temper the Inflammation, and mitigate the Heat of Urine, I make some
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:206364:123"/>cooling Emulsion after the following manner, to be often drank on those days when he does not purge.</p>
                     <p>♃ Melon and Pumkin Seed, of each half an ounce, White Poppy Seed two drachms, sweet Almonds peel'd eight in number, bray them in a Marble Mortar, and pour thereon by little and little one pound and an half of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley water; strain all, and then add thereto of Sugar Candy so much as is sufficient; mix them, and make up an Emulsion according to Art.</p>
                     <p>In a very sanguine Temper, and an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Malady, after having used Catharticks for one month or thereabouts; I most commonly advise to take eight or ten ounces of bloud from the right arm: I am not of the opinion that the Patient should be let bloud sooner, lest by this occasion the Contagion take deeper root: I think not much of Injections into the Yard, seeing they use often to doe more hurt than good, either by reason of their biting acrimony, or their astringent quality; nevertheless toward the end of the Cure a small quantity of Rose Water may be injected.</p>
                     <p>I have found as yet no better method than this I use, which has always answered my expectation, especially in those that are easily purged; for in those who are purged with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:206364:124"/>some difficulty, the Cure, though it always holds, yet is not completed till after a long time. From these persons Bloud is to be again taken, and the Catharticks they use are to be sharpned, and to be more often repeated, and continued for a longer time; or Clysters are to be used in the same manner; for purging in this case is in a manner as good as all other things; and in this distemper, if in any other, it may be truly affirmed, that he who cleanses well, heals well, provided he abstain from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, which I am very certain do by their astringency, and too healing quality, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and rivet the remainder of the Disease that ought to be expelled out of the Body. Hence, as I have frequently observed, Tumours grew in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> if these Waters were drank in the beginning or State, and worse Symptomes, as Caruncles, if they were drank toward the end of the distemper, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, although the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be frequently prescribed in the said case, agreeable to the custome that obtains at this day.</p>
                     <p>Nor am I ignorant what great things some Empiricks pretend in the Cure of this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome, relating partly to the shortness of the time, in which they complete it, and partly to the high Names, and mighty Titles, of those Medicines which they employ in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:206364:124"/>of it; in the mean time I have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found by too frequent observation, that the Matter that should have been exterminated from the Body, was detained therein by the force of astringents, and exposed the Patients to great inconveniencies; so that the virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being very often transmitted to the bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, does produce the universal Pox: Nor have I observed the Decoction of the drying woods to have been used with better advantage, though they were attended with less danger: With this (being as is pretended a specifick Medicine) the Patient's whole Body, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the part affected, were over-heated, and farther inflamed; and sometimes also the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> that had vanished (which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I observed) came again.</p>
                     <p>But it is to be considered, that if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Gland be covered all round with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce, and the borders thereof be so much swelled, hard, and callous, by reason of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, that it cannot be by any means brought back, it would be in vain to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the cure of the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> by the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest purgatives, though never so often repeated, unless at the same time the part so affected be reduced to it's natural state, by removing the hardness and tumour, by which means there is way made for the <hi>Gonorrhea:</hi> And this I doe by the following Fomentation:</p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:206364:125"/>
                     <p>♃ Marsh Mallows, and Lilly Roots, of each one ounce and a half, Marsh Mallows, Longwore Elder, and Henbane Leaves, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamel, and Melilot flowers, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Lin-seed, and seed of Faenygreek, of each half an ounce; boil them according to Art in Fountain water; make up a Fomentation of all to be laid on the place for the space of one hour, twice or thrice a day; after this fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I order that the part affected be annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Lin-seed Oil, newly drawn; then I cause to apply a Plaister of the Mucilaginous part, of a Lamb skin to the sides of the Prepuce, round about the swelling: But if the Ulcer, either in the sides of the Prepuce, or in the Gland, by reason of it's callosity hinder the retraction of the Prepuce, besides the said fomentation, I prescribe likewise the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liniment:</p>
                     <p>♃ Ointment of Basil six drachms, of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco two drachms, Precipitate wash'd in Rose Water, and very well refin'd, half a drachm; mix them together, and make up a Liniment of them; dip a little rag therein, and apply it to the Ulcer always after the fore-mentioned Fomentation has been used.</p>
                     <p>But when, either by reason of stopping the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> too soon, by too violent exercise, or any other cause, the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which is now the seat of the Disease, is thereby very much
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:206364:125"/>swelled; I apply the foresaid fomentation twice a day to the part affected, in case that the pain, and the tumour are not diminished by the ordinary Cataplasm of Oxycrate and Bean flower: Whilst these external remedies are applyed; I continue to attack the Enemy with both Cathartick, and cooling Medicines taken inwardly, and with the forementioned dyet which we have already prescribed; nor do I think it amiss to take nine or ten ounces of Bloud (on every such occasion) from that Arm which answers to the swelled Testicle, if the greatness of the Tumour, and vehemence of the pain require it: And so much for the <hi>Gonorrhea.</hi>

                     <p>But when the distemper is come to such a height, that it ought to be called strictly the Veneral distemper, or the confirm'd Pox: Other means are to be used, and a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere course is to be taken for removing a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease that is so inveterate; seeing for ought I know there has been no experiment brought to prove that this distemper has been cured any other way, than by Salivation raised by Quick-Silver, whatever some of both the Learned and Ignorant have temerariously, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently talked of other Methods of Cure:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:206364:126"/>Therefore seeing Salivation is the only Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Remedy in this case; it is my business here to shew what my Reason (such as it is) and Observation have taught me, concerning exciting, and managing Salivation aright.</p>
                     <p>But first, I cannot so much as imagine what is meant by the frequent Advices that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by way of Caution, to prepare the Body by Cathartick, and Digesting Medicines, as by Bathing, and the like; not to say any thing of Bleeding, which some believe to be the principal thing in this Case: Seeing if we have a due regard to Truth, we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the Matter is brought to this, that Salivation is to be procured by a Poison (for we do not as yet know any wholesome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament by which it can be excited, nor yet can the Patient be safe without the use of it;) the question is, whether it is best to give Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to a Body when it is strong and vigorous, and so able to grapple with it's enemy, and stand the shock of all the violence it offers, or when it is weakned with Phlebotomie, and a spare diet; he that weighs the thing impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially will undoubtedly conclude, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to doe nothing at all in this Case, than to expose the Patient to mischief by tampering with him, to such a rigorous extremity; nay, experience teaches us, that those who are not weakned by any Evacuations, or by any other
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:206364:126"/>means do much better endure the fatigue of a Salivation, then others whose Nerves as it were have been cut before Battle. Omitting therefore such an hurtfull prelude, so soon as ever I am sent for, I prescribe an Ointment of Hog's Lard two ounces, and of <hi>Crude Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> one ounce; and I mix therewith none of the hot Oils, nor any thing else; seeing the Unguent will be the worse, if it be fetter'd with any such addition, and will never be the more effectual, if such things added be no wise ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and it is possible that such addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under the name of Correctives, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the same thing here, (if they perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing,) that they do, as we see by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when joined to Cathartick Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> they cause gripes, and render the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Purgatives more intolerable, which arise from the Combate that happens betwixt the Antidote and the Cathartick, all whose Purging virtue does consist in this, that it is an Enemy to Man's Nature. But I appoint the Patient himself to take one third part of the said Unguent, and anoint his own arms, legs, and thighs therewith for three nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (including that night that I was sent for,) but that he touch not his Arm-pits, or Groin with it; and let him defend his Belly from the Unguent, by putting a Linen Cloth upon it, and tying it behind him: After the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:206364:127"/>third anointing the Gums swell for the most part, and the Salivation begins; but if this does not happen within three days, and after the third anointing; then the Patient must take eight grains of Turbith Mineral in the Conserve of Red Roses, and after each Vomit, or Stool, let him take a draught of a warm Posset: When he begins to spit, the onely busines of the Physician is to consider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Salivation in the most exact man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imaginable; lest by a rash encrease of it, the Patient's Life be endangered: When the Salivation is come to a just state, (so that two quarts are voided at the mouth in the space of twenty four hours) or the Symptoms disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, (which for the most part happens after the fourth day from the state, or height of the Salivation) although the Salivation proceed moderately, the Patients Shirt is to be changed, and it will be fit that for some the bed clothes which may be have been used since the time of the last washing be removed, and clean Linen put in their room; seeing the foul Linen having drawn in much of the Unguent, is apt to raise the Salivation to a greater height, and protract it to a longer time than is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Patient; but if it happen that the Salivation cease before the Symptoms do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together disappear; it must immediately be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved by one scruple of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> given <hi>

                     <p>It falls out sometimes, especially in such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are habitually open, that after using the Unguent once or twice (<hi>viz.</hi> so soon as the blood begins to be sensible of the Quicksilver) Nature presently sets her self vigorously to work that she may expell this Enemy by the intestines, whence not only mucous ejections and griping of the Gutts, do happen, as in those who have a dysenterie; but also the Cure of the distemper is hindred; seeing it only yields to Salivation. In this case Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry must by no means be meddled with, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for outward Application, nor inward Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, till these Symptoms altogether disappear; and moreover the said loosness (which happens for the most part before the Salivation is well begun) must be stopt by the use of <hi>Laudanum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidum</hi> encreasing and repeating the Dose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the violence of the Symptome, or a drachm and a half of <hi>Diascorides</hi> swallow'd down sometimes, as need shall require: When the flux is over, the Salivation uses to proceed in regular manner, though it was scarce discernible before.</p>
                     <p>When the Patient is recovering, only his mouth being Ulcerated (which is the genuine Fruit of Salivation) the Salivation which now daily decays, must not be stopp'd by Purging, or in any other manner whatsoever; for it may so fall out, that even after the pain is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaged, and the Ulcers are dried, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:206364:128"/>of the Venereal Ferment may be lurking in the Body; and afterwards raise a new sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless this moderate spitting be permitted, which will cease after the Patient is so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that he can expose himself for some time to the open Air. I think it therefore a thing of dangerous consequence, either to purge off by Catharticks, or to dry up by a Decoction of the Woods, the remainder of the Salivation; upon which practice, which is common under the pretence of either clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Body of the Mercury, or correcting it's Malignity; Relapses do follow, which befall miserable Creatures, who long for their health (after such vast expences, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive toil, and dolorous fatigue,) to which state they would certainly have arrived, if the Salivation had ceased in it's own time. It would therefore be much better to promote the Salivation, by giving a Dose of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> once in the week, even after the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is very well in health, and walks abroad (which I sometimes have enjoined for some months) than stop it too soon.</p>
                     <p>But although I am against Purging in the declenson of Salivation, for the reasons already shewn; yet it may so happen that in its State it neither can nor ought to be omitted, <hi>viz</hi> whensoever the Matter is so ill managed that the Salivation being raised to too great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:206364:128"/>does put the Patient's Life in danger; in which case it is not only safe, but necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to use a Cathartick for reducing the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that degree, which may proceed with the ease and good plight of the Patient, and so it is to be left.</p>
                     <p>If any one now ask, whether or no we must rest satisfied with bare Salivation, and use no Purgative, nor other solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, after it is over? I answer, besides what has been said, which is confirmed by Reason and Experience; that I would very fain know why it is thought more necessary to purge after the Salivation, than to excite a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation after a Purge; seeing Purgatives (as Scammony, and other sharp Medicaments of that Nature) do leave somewhat of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Body, which yet we leave to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by whose energy whatever Poison lies there, is at last subdued, provided the Person that has been purged betake himself to his wonted diet, exercise, and live in a more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air than before. And farther I would very willingly know what Maxim of Art we trust to, when we pretend to expell the remainders of Mercury by Catharticks, and not only neglect but hinder that Genuine, and only Method (<hi>viz.</hi> by Salivation) whereby Nature uses and ought to effect it? Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused apprehensions of things proceed from the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:206364:129"/>small measure of the Light of Reason, which we poor Mortals now enjoy, whence it is that our knowledg being only superficial, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the Truth which lies at the bottom; but catch at any shadow, or appearance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and embrace, as they say a Cloud instead of <hi>Juno:</hi> Thus weakly arm'd we proceed to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litations by discourse, and feloniously wound our own Judgments by rivetting our former ill grounded prejudices, with such vigour, and to such a height that we would pass our own phantastical Ideas and incoherent dreams for cogent and demonstrative Principles, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of which, if I be not mistaken we have now in hand.</p>
                     <p>Although the Cure is completed in the most Persons after the manner aforesaid, <hi>viz.</hi> by anointing for three nights together, and giving a Dose of Turbith Mineral when the Salivation does not proceed aright, as also <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius dulcis</hi> for some times, when it ceases too soon; yet it is seriously to be considered, that some persons have an <hi>Idiosyncrasie,</hi> or a certain peculiar Temperament, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Salivation as Purgation, (and the same for the most part in the same persons; that those who are purged with difficulty are also brought to salivate with difficulty;) so that the received Method can hardly cause an Exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gumms in some, much less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:206364:129"/>that degree of Salivation that is requisite for carrying off the Distemper. As to this sort of Patients the Physician ought to use all the caution imaginable, that he do not force Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with an obstinate importunity in spight of Nature, which may have an utter aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that sort of Evacuation; they who have not understood this, have by reason of the darkness of their own minds, deprived many of their Patients of the light as well as comfort of their lives; for in Bodies of that Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whensoever one shall pertinaciously load the Patient with Medicaments, whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or internal, instead of a perfect Salivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is nothing to be perceived as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it; but gripings of the Guts and a bloudy Flux, (Nature expelling the Poison of the Mercury by the postern,) or pains of the Stomach and Sickness, cold Sweatings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreadfull Symptomes shall appear, so that the poor Patient, if he deliver not up his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Soul, can yet hardly appear to be in the state of the Living: As to these, though it may be allowed to the Physician, that when he has in vain expected Salivation for the space of four or five days after the last annointing, he may repeat the said annointing together with Turbith Mineral, (intermitting some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt every two inunctions,) yet he ought to make Conscience of this, that whilst he has in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:206364:130"/>vain endeavoured to raise a Salivation with so eager an application, he proceed not to force it contrary to Nature: Therefore this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in my Judgment is to be observed by the Physician; that so soon as ever Sickness of the Stomach, or gripings of the Guts do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, in that case, he presently abstain from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remedies till these Symptomes do quite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; for when the number and force of the Medicaments are encreased to force Salivation in a constitution that is altogether against it, a bloudy Flux shall certainly follow upon the griping of the Guts, and death shall quickly follow upon the sickness of the Stomach: Whilst on the contrary if he make no greater haste than good speed, and proceed with due deliberation, by giving one scruple of <hi>Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us dulcis</hi> once or twice in the Week, either by it self, or with one drachm of <hi>Diascordium;</hi> if the Patient be inclinable to be loose, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess will answer expectation: For although the Salivation never come to the height, yet the Patient shall spit more copiously than ever he used to do, and a stench, the concomitant of a right Salivation, shall not relinquish this which is of a moderate degree; whence it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that that Putrefaction or alteration, (or what ever it be,) has reached the Bloud, and the Humours, which either produces a Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or is produced with it. And by this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:206364:130"/>Method all the Symptomes of this Distemper shall be at length overcome, if there be a due time taken for it.</p>
                     <p>But it must be observed, that although Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is very much preferable to all other Remedies for rooting out a confirmed Pox, yet it cannot by any means heal the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> that accompanies it, nor shall the latter be stopp'd, though the former be absolutely cured: From whence it may be concluded, that Mercury contains no specifick Virtue, by which the Veneral distemper may be immediately van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished; although perhaps it may be called a Mediate, or Remote Specifick, in so far as it does expell the disease by the means of a Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, almost in the same improper sense as a Chirurgion's Penknife may be called a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick for curing an Ulcer in the side. But to return to the present Subject, whensoever the Confirmed Pox and a <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> happen to be together, the Cure of the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken either before, or after Salivation, and in my opinion it is both more safe, and more easie after the Salivation; seeing a <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> which is accompanied with the Pox, is more difficulty Cured; that which has been in some measure subdued by the preceding Salivation is more easily rooted out: But we must be sure to abstain from Catharticks, so long as the least remainder of a Salivation does as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:206364:131"/>yet continue: And therefore it will be the surer way to depend upon Turbith Mineral, given once or twice a Week for doing the work, than to trust to any other Purgatives whatsoever; by which means the Salivation shall be somewhat promoted, whilst in the mean time the matter that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Gonorrhea</hi> shall be gradually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be observed if any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, commonly called an <hi>Exostosis,</hi> or bony excrescence, invade a Bone, which continues so long time that the Bone comes to have a caries, it will be altogether in vain to attempt the Cure, either by Salivation, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Method whatsoever, unless we also use means for removing of this mischief: And therefore the Bone is to be made bare by a Caustick, and as soon as possible it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliated as they call it, by using such remedies as are proper for producing this effect.</p>
                     <p>As for an Ulcerated Mouth, which those ordinarily have, who have undergone a Salivation, if either the Patient be under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable pain, or his mouth be so excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it run with Bloud, and that both night and day it must be very often garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised, either with Damask Rose Water, or with Milk and Water, or with a Decoction of Barley Water, Mallow Roots, and some Seeds
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:206364:131"/>of Quinces. This is the only memorable Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome that I know of that follows upon Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, at least when it is performed in a due manner, and the truth, is if the pain and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the mouth could be by any art prevented, the Cure of this distemper would not be much more troublesome than that of others that are of much less note.</p>
                     <p>As for the Patien's Diet, and the rest of his Conduct; in my judgment the same Rules are to be observed in Salivation till it be almost brought to a close, as are observed in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; and seeing he that has taken some Purgative Medicine, is onely to mind this, that he keep himself within his Chamber from the Cold, and moderately eat such food as is of good and easie digestion; I do not as yet apprehend why the Patient should either be confined to his bed, or be restrained from moderate eating, which would strengthen and encourage him in the conflict of Nature with the Poison: From such irregular Methods it is, that when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been totally oppressed with so great a burthen, a great many persons being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted in their Spirits, and deprived of all manner of strength through the sweating, purging, and unnecessary fasting enjoined on them, (besides the mischief done to them by the Mercury) have been miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:206364:132"/>and very often when the disease is vanquished, the Patient being destitute of that stock of Spirits that is requisite for his perfect recovery yields to fate through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but if he avoid grim Death, he buys his Life at the price of so great and many Torments, that he has but a dear bargain of it: Of which one of the Modern Poets has expressed himself elegantly enough:
<q>
                           <l>Graviora morbis patimur Remedia,</l>
                           <l>Nec Vita tanti est, vivere ut possis, mori.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is easie in this place to answer an Objection; How comes it to pass that some persons having this distemper in a great extream, (<hi>viz.</hi> in such a state as has been just now shewn,) are obliged to go to <hi>France</hi> for their Cure? The reason of which, in my Judgment, is this; our Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thick and moist, is not so proper for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Spirits in this sort of persons, who have the Oeconomie of the Body sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and their strength ruduced to the lowest; whereas that of <hi>France</hi> being more wholesome and clear, is more apt to restore the Spirits, and repair decay'd strength: Not that the Men of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there, though Learned, have a better Method of Curing the distemper, than we
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:206364:132"/>have in <hi>England:</hi> But that I may return to the diet.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I am of Opinion, (and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is for me) that besides water grewel, <hi>Panado</hi> posset drink, and warm Ale; that we may, nay, we ought to allow the Patient Veal, Pullets, and the like, to be taken moderately; and that he be permitted to eat a little of a Rabet, Pullet, or Lamb, so soon as the the Tumour of his Gums is fallen, so as he may make use of his Teeth; that he may keep his Bed, or sit by the Fire, as he himself pleases: For seeing this Distemper is cured by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation, not by Diaphoreticks; I cannot imagine why the Patient should be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with to much heat without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
                     <p>This said Method, as it is more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, seeing it does not impose upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient so long a Preparation of his Body for so many days before Salivation, nor those solemn Purges or Decoctions after Salivation; so I am very well assured that it is much more easie, less dangerous, and does not so much expose the Patient to a Relapse; which every one who has been used to the other practice, will soon be satisfied in, when he comes to try this Method; I at last found therein all imaginable success,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:206364:133"/>as to very many Patients; of whom some had undergone more than once the fatigue of a Salivation, suffering still a Relapse upon it, upon such occasions, and for such causes as we have formerly mentioned.</p>

            <head>ANNOTATIONS ON THE FIRST PART.</head>
            <byline>By <hi>WILLIAM SALMON,</hi> Professor of Physick.</byline>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IF the Mass of Blood be sensibly corrupted, it may be depurated by gentle Medicines, such as Volatile Salt of Vipers, or Vipers themselves.</hi> Pag. 44 Line 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> Our Author calls this Gentle Means, and so it is indeed, if you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Form of its Operation: but if you have respect to the Effects, 'tis no such thing, but one of the greatest, most stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent of Medicaments in the whole Animal Kingdom; and some question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any in the Mineral exceed it; I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain none in the Vegetable come near it by many degrees, I speak by a long and through
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206364:134"/>Experience; <hi>Guajacum</hi> it self, yea, and <hi>Sarsa</hi> too, are much below it. But here an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection arises, how they shall do that live far off in the Country, or cannot get the Salt of Vipers, or if it may be had, are so poor, that they cannot purchase it? To this I answer, that they must make use of Vipers Flesh. 1. By boyling, and then the Flesh may be eaten, and the Broth may be drank, as if it was made of Eeles: but by this way some few of the volatile Parts are lost. 2. By drying the Flesh, and beating it into Powder: of which Powder the Sick may take two Drams a Day, <hi>viz.</hi> a Dram or more in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fasting, and last at Night going to Bed. 3. In the Wine made of them, made as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in our <hi>Doron Medicum, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Sect.</hi> 39. Thus, <hi>Take choise Canary</hi> pound viij. <hi>Live large Vipers</hi> vj. <hi>or</hi> viij. <hi>Suffocate the Vipers in the Wine, then let it pass a gentle Fermentation: and after two Months, when it is fine and clear, the Sick may begin to drink of it.</hi> The Sick may take six or eight Spoonfuls in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fasting, and as much at Night going to Bed. This Wine is very full of Volatile Salt, and most effectual to the Purpose intended. 4. By taking our <hi>Powers of Vipers,</hi> mentioned in our <hi>Phylaxa. Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.2.7.8.12. You may give twenty, thirty, or forty Drops in Milk, Broth, or a Glass of Canary, two or three times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206364:134"/>a Day. These Viperine Medicines are safe, and cannot be given amiss, should it not be the <hi>Pox,</hi> but a <hi>Leprosie, inveterate Herpes, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and high graduated Scurvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Also if nothing appears but some Piles or Warts in the Secret Parts, which without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sign, 'tis not to be thought the Pox; but if with those Signs there be Fissures towards the Anus, ulcerous Hemorrhoids, and Warts in other Parts, there is sufficient assurance of the Distemper,</hi> Pag. 45. Line 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> Though sometimes it may not be the <hi>Pox,</hi> when there is Piles or Warts only in the secret Parts; yet sometimes it may be the <hi>Pox</hi> for all that no more may appear, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what our Author has said; but then the Artist ought to enquire what Course of Life the Patient has liv'd before, that he may make a Judgment from the Preludes of the Distemper: However, whether it be the <hi>Pox</hi> or no, the former Medicaments may be of use here; and if the Sick pleases, they may take the said Powers of Vipers in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Our <hi>Hercules</hi> in Canary: the way of making the said <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Infusion,</hi> you may see in Our <hi>Phylaxa Medicinae, Cap.</hi> 47. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.6.11.12.15.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>I have seen a young Woman who had never known Man, who was covered all over her Body (the Privities only excepted) with Crusts of an Inch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206364:135"/>thickness, and as broad as ones Hand.</hi> Pag. 46. Line 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> Our Author is not willing to have this to be the <hi>Pox,</hi> and it may be, what he thinks it to be; for an inveterate <hi>Herpes</hi> or <hi>Serpigo</hi> may have that appearance: But if the Patient was of age enough to get the <hi>Pox,</hi> by Venery, I should have little Charity to believe it to be otherwise, for that I have known some, yea, innocent lookt Creatures, who have denied the Matter of Fact with an Oath, yea, with many Oaths, who, before the Cure has been over, has confest the thing, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they perjured themselves to deny. In this Case our Authors Method by <hi>Mercuriates</hi> (without Salivation) is very good: as also all the Means before directed. Besides <hi>Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Dulcis,</hi> and other gentle Preparations of Mercury; I should use Our <hi>Hercules</hi> as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our aforesaid <hi>Phylaxa. Cap.</hi> 47. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. I have never found it fail what I designed for. Outwardly the Sick may wash the Parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the following Water. <hi>Take Lime Water boyling hot, a Gallon; put it into a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware earthen Bason; dissolve in it sweet Sublimate in fine Powder two Ounces: So a blackish Powder will precipitate.</hi> This Water keep in a Glass Bottle for the Purposes aforesaid.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>I know by Experience, that the surest course that can be taken about this kind of Pox, is by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206364:135"/>way of Vapor, which does reach the infected Bones; but seeing this Method is something dangerous, and may have ill Consequences, it requires both Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Dexterity to accomplish it.</hi> Pag. 49. Line 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> The kind of <hi>Pox</hi> here intended, is the worst of <hi>Poxes, viz.</hi> That wherein there is a <hi>Caries,</hi> or Rottenness of the Bone, which is scarcely cured by any Method or Preparation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> nay not by Salivation it self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly given, or outwardly by Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which indeed I account the most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of all. Our Author says, the surest way is by <hi>Fumigation,</hi> the Method of which we shall hereafter teach. <hi>Wiseman</hi> in his <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery</hi> commends these Troches. <hi>Take Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar</hi> ℥ij. <hi>Crude Mercury</hi> ℥j. <hi>Mastich, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, Juniper Gum; ana.</hi> ℥ss. <hi>Storax Calamita, Benjamin, ana</hi> ʒiij. <hi>make all into a subtil Powder, with which a sufficient quantity of Turpentine, make into Troches for use, each weighing about three Drams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>They cannot perform a Cure at first, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those who make use of the Mercurial Oyntment: there has likewise been some whom Salivation by Friction or Ʋnction could never work upon.</hi> Pag. 50. Line 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is true generally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that this our Author doth so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against this Way or Method of Cure,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206364:136"/>because for the most part it is no Cure, but the Introduction of a whole Regiment of Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Deplorable Symptoms, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that the magnifyers of this way of Fluxation can say.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>And therefore it often falls out by reason of some of those Faults I have shewn, that the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Distemper is not cured, but only its Symptoms, and that some of the Venereal Ferment does still remain in the Body.</hi> Pag. 51. Line 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> That is to say, by some of those almost impossible to be avoided Faults, which happen in the Method by Unction; and though many times, some of the raging Symptoms, at the time of the Salivation seem to vanish, or are laid asleep; yet new arise in many Patients, which are far worse than their former, and sometimes prove uncurable to boot: I have known many Patients who have been throughly salivated twice, yea, three times for a <hi>Pox,</hi> by this Method, whom it has left worse than at first it found them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Faithfulness and Care of the Undertaker; and then this false Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has followed, <hi>viz. that there were some kinds of Poxes, so inveterate and malign, that no Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation could cure:</hi> which was, and is a false Deduction from the Premises. And truly, if I may freely speak my Thoughts, I firmly believe that most of the Persons, in whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206364:136"/>there is a <hi>Caries</hi> or Rottenness of the Bones (which is the worst sort of <hi>Pox,</hi> and by some accounted uncurable) that it oftner, yea, ten times to one, arises from the unhappy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure by Unction, rather than from the Malignity or Poyson of the Disease: though I do not say, but that some have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily met with a good and safe Cure that way too, yet am almost confident that ten to one has either miscarried, or been made worse by it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>'Tis indeed an Abuse, and one ought to use Diligence, if he cannot know the Nature of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury to the bottom, to find out a Method whereby it may be, in such a manner prepared, as it may he given without Danger.</hi> Pag. 54. Line. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is good Advice of the Author, and therefore he has been so industrious as to fix upon a safe and substantial Medicine in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this end, which you will have in its due place: he has not given you many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, nor multiplied Medicines without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, having met with one that is good, true, and indubitable. Nor will we multiply ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny after him, but either confirm the Use and Practise which this prudent Author has laid down, by manifold Experiments of our Own, or produce some one or two other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no ways inferior to his, which will not only supply the Place, but also perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>(Mercury does contain) a great deal of Salt, but not an Alcaly, as some pretend, but an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acid Salt, very like that which is in Sulphur Mineral.</hi> Pag. 55. Line 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> I must confess, I cannot but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent here from this Author, nor am I alone, but have on my side very great and good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; I am sure the <hi>Pox</hi> proceeds, and is made up of an extream and vehement Acid, and it is the natural Course of the Cure, to proceed with Alcalies, that may sweeten the Blood and Juices; and if Mercury was such an Acid as he would make it, it would rather be inimical than beneficial for this purpose; but this is not the place to enter the Lists of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about a thing, which (let its Nature be what it will) so perfectly answers our Ends.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>It is ponderous, because it abounds with Salt; and Experience doth shew, that Liquors are by so much the more heavy, as they contain the more Salt; the same may be observed in all sorts of Wood.</hi> Pag. 56. Line 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This seems to be a Paradox, and may be thought not to be universally true: for some suppose that the Sulphurs of some Metals cause their Heaviness; as in Gold, which is the heaviest of all Metals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a much larger quantity of Sulphur than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206364:137"/>of Salt. To instance also in Woods. Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum is an extream heavy Wood, yet its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Composition is Sulphur, next to a dead Earth, and I am confident from Experience, that it contains near ten times the quantity of Sulphur, that it has of Salt of any kind.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>This Mercurial Vapor, meeting in its way with some Sulphurs, with which the Mines do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, by joyning therewith, compose a Mixture, that makes the Mineral (or native) Cinnabar, not unlike that we see in the Articifical Cinnabar, which is only a Mixture of Sulphur and Mercury.</hi> pag. 58. line. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is true in Nature: how the Artificial is made, we have taught in our <hi>Pharmacopaeia, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 54. to which I refer you. The Cinnabars of all kinds, as well the Artificial as the Antimonial and Native, are great Medicines, and in a wise and skilful Hand will perform Wonders in the Medical Art, and may be so prepared, that they shall perform as much in the Cure of the Pox, Leprosie, Gout, Scurvy, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack Disaffections, as any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine whatsoever, yea, even to outvie with the Greatest.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>(Mercury) excites Salivation, the Heat of the Body reducing it into a Vapor: and seeing there is Acids in all sorts of Bodies, those Acids do easily joyn themselves to the Mercury, which in its self
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:206364:138"/>does contain an Acid Salt, and those Acids being in conjunction therewith, make it corrosive, in like manner almost as the Acids of Vitriol and Sea Salt make Quick silver, Sublimate Corrosive.</hi> Page 60. Line 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> But we have before declared our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that Mercury is an Alcaly, and truly I believe it to be one of the greatest Alcalies in Nature, which is in part demonstrated by its immediate Fermentation, and being disquieted, being mixed with any Acid of what kind soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that this Author had more exquisitely spoken, if he had said thus. <hi>Mercury, by the Heat of the Body, and Acidity of its Juices, being turned into a Vapor, excites a Salivation; for the Acid Salts of the Body meeting, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Alcalious Substance of the Mercury, immediately promotes a Fermentation of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Juices; and the Mercury being made Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive (as Sublimate is with the Acids of Vitriol and Sea-salt) by the sharpness and Corrosion of its Particles, makes a Separation and Participation of the malign Humors and poysonous Salt from the truly natural and benign, so that those evil Juices being joyned with the Mercury, and the Mercury, by the Heat and Fermentation, forced to ascend upwards to the Salivatick Glandules, they are actually separated, and so carried forth out of the Body.</hi>

            <p n="12">XII. <hi>Sometimes Mercury does only purge by Stool, and 'tis thought that in such a Case, it does meet with some alcalious Matter, which makes it let go those Acids, and precipitates the Mercury into the lower Parts.</hi> page 62. line 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> I can no ways concede to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but do rather think, that the Cause of the Purging by Stool, is, when the Alcaly of the Mercury much exceeds in Strength and Proportion the Acid Salts of the Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it has not that Natural Propensity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which otherwise it would have. But there are many other Reasons for this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which we cannot stand here to enumerate.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. <hi>We see, that when there is a Dissolution of Mercury made with Acids, as the Spirits or Oyls of Sulphur, Vitriol, Allum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>those Acids are the more fixed, and the Mercury is sublimed with the greater Difficulty.</hi> Page 62. Line 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is wholly a Mistake; for in this Case of the Dissolution of Mercury with acid Spirits or Oyls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Mercury is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred; and its Alcaly (by reason of the Disproportion of the Acid) is fixed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salt (for that almost all Acid Salts are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fixed Salts) and it is a received Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Nature, that the Weaker must subject it self to the Stronger; and this is the Reason that the Mercury cannot so easily be sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206364:139"/>or ascend, because it is as it were fixed or chained down by the Fetters of the fixt acid Salt.</p>

               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is a difficulty, but may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be determined by any one skilful in our Profession: and them that are not skillful are not fit to practice. This is certain, that it ought to be given, till all the Accidents are vanisht: but in my Opinion that is not enough, two or three Doses ought still to be taken after all, yea although the Patient may think himself to be perfectly well; that the said Accidents may not only vanish, but that no Leven or Seed of the Disease may be lest in the Blood and Humors; and then also Viper Broth, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the other preparation of Vipers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at <hi>Sect.</hi> I. of these Annotations ought to be taken for twelve or fourteen days, where by, the recrements of the Disease (if any yet remain) will be so throughly carried off, that the sick will be in no future danger of a Relapse.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:206364:143"/>as the Preparation of the same Medicine, here laid down by our Author — but does things much more mildly and pleasantly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires a longer time, and more Doses to do it in: for which cause sake I always keep of both sorts by me, to wit, the mild or gentle which I call <hi>Angelus Mineralis;</hi> and the strong, or most powerful which I call the <hi>Impetus Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> because <hi>it forcibly invades the distemper, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently assaults the Poyson, and certainly eradicates the malignity, performing the Cure as well with great safty as speed.</hi>

Of this <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> you may make a Diet as is taught in the <hi>same Chapter Sect.</hi> 15. in these words. <hi>Take of this Our Hercules or Panacea five ounces: Canary two quarts; shake them together; and let them stand in a warm Infusion for a week, shaking the Glass twice a day: then being well settled pour off the clear Wine (which will have neither colour, taste, nor smell, more than it had when it went on) and keep it for a Diet.</hi> Dose a quarter of a Pint in the Morning, or more if you please, and as much at night going to Bed. This much exceeds a <hi>Guaiacum</hi> and <hi>Sarsa</hi> Diet, yea that made of Vipers, and may be taken without offence at Meals, even by the most delicate Pallats. This Diet you must renew, by putting the like quantity of fresh Canary upon the same Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and you may repeat the Infusion upon the same faeces or <hi>Hercules,</hi> seven or eight times,; (and so long the Powder will hold good, and make the Infusion strong enough) which will be sufficient for any ordinary Cure:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206364:144"/>the Patient may take this Diet drink even in Company, and yet the most prying Eye never take notice of it.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>There is no Pox but what may be cured by this Medicine, such a degree of it only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where there is a</hi> Caries <hi>or putrefaction of the Bones of the Nose or Skull, which cannot be throughly effected, but by a method that is extreamly troublesom and tedious,</hi> page 69. line 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon</hi> The Medicine he here means is his <hi>Solar Precipitate</hi> before mentioned, which is our <hi>Impetus Mineralis.</hi> He excepts a Pox with a <hi>Caries:</hi> whether it may cure such a Pox or no, I cannot be positive in, because I have had no Experience of it in that case; though I am apt to believe it would go a great way in the Cure, if it was managed by a prudent hand, given for some time longer then in the former Cases. And our Author <hi>page</hi> 87. saith, <hi>We may reasonably think it snfficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>And therefore in this Case, it is better to salivate the Patient not by means of an Ʋnguent, which I would advise no Body to, because of its ill Consequences: besides—the Mercury does not penetrate so far as the putrified Bone, to destroy the Ferment that infects it.</hi> pag. 7. line 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is very true, and therefore we can advise no Body to a Method so unhappy, where other ways much more excellent are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206364:144"/>known, and which we shall explicate in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel hereof.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. <hi>But this Salivation must be performed by Fumigation or Vapor, for which we shall shew the best Method.</hi> page 70. line 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmon.</hi> Our Author here promises the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Salivating by Fumigation, but has no where in his whole Book shown the particular Way how it should be done. And therefore, for the Sakes of the Ignorant, we shall here explicate it. The Fume may be made with <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> either Native or Artificial. Some Authors think the Artificial to be the best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the Burning, by reason of the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, it has a much greater and more piercing Fume, piercing further, and working stronger than Quick-silver by Unction, or any other way of touching the Body. Thus, <hi>Take Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar</hi> ℥j. <hi>Frankinscence, Mastich, Benjamin, Cortex, Winteranus, ana</hi> ʒj. <hi>all being in fine Powder, with Turpentine or Mucilage, of Gum Tragacanth, make a Mass for Troches, of which make tmenty four for eight times.</hi> If there be many Ulcers in the Body, you must make the Troches stronger, after this manner. <hi>Take Cinabar one Ounce: Frankinscence, Mastick, Myrrh, Amber, of each an Ounce, Cortex Winteranus, Cloves, Nutmegs, Zedoary, ana</hi> ℥ ss: <hi>all being in fine Powder with Turpentine or Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, make thirty two Troches for eight Fumagations.</hi> But if the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206364:145"/>Ulcers are many, and very Malignant, you must yet use stronger than these, made after this manner. <hi>Take Cinabar</hi> ℥ j. <hi>Frankincense, Myrrh, Amber, Benjamin, Crude Antimony, ana</hi> ℥ j. <hi>of our Hercules, Verdigrise, ana</hi> ʒij. <hi>Cortex Winteranus</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Cloves, Nutmegs, Zeadory, ana</hi> ℥ss. <hi>all being in fine Powder, with Turpentine or Musci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage make two and thirty Troches for eight times.</hi> And if the party be strong, some add <hi>a dram of Orpiment or a dram of some precipitate,</hi> with this caution, that they avoid the fume, so as it may not come into their Mouth or Nose. The way of using these Troches is this. Put the Sick naked into some warm close place, which is kept from the Air, as a hot House, or a Tub for the purpose, made beneath of boards, arched like a Tent, and covered all over with a Mat; Or which is much better <hi>Hartmans</hi> Sweating Chair: with in this, let him sit, and take the fume ascending from the Troches within, being thrown upon live Coals: his face must be out, as the Nature of the Place imports, that he may endure it the longer, and his Head so covered, that the Air come not at it: but towards the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on let the Headreceive some of the fumes also; and let him endure it so long as he can endure it without fainting: then wraping warm Sheets round him, carry him to a fresh warm place, and put him into a warm Bed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206364:145"/>to sweat for three or four hours or more, as long as he can endure it. These Fumes are to be used once every day, if the Sick be strong, but if weak once every other day: or if he grows faint, let him rest a day, or so, till his Spirits be recruited, and then repeat the Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation again, till by his soreness of Mouth, and fluxing or spitting, you see reason to give over. And because this way by Fumigation, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens more than that by Unction, the Sick is permitted, to eat oftner than otherwise, and that good, wholsom and nourishing Food; for too much Abstinence in this case will certainly do hurt.</p>
